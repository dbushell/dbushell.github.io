Read the notes below <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://codepen.io/dbushell/full/8e6a1ee85418f3c5abe839647dbcdec5/\">the CodePen demo</a>. The CSS there is also commented.</p>\n<h2 id=\"usability\">Usability</h2>\n<p>When it comes to responsive tables there is no one size fits all solution. Tables are good for housing a lot of data but on small screens data comparison is difficult because the visible real estate is very limited. There will never be a single plugin that solves this problem.</p>\n<p>My solution simply makes <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> elements scrollable and offers an optional axis flip if appropriate to the content. It doesn’t magically solve the user experience.</p>\n<p>Maybe a table isn’t the answer!</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for professional front-end design <a href=\"/contact/\">give me a shout</a>. We can find a more accessible way to display your content.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scrolling-shadows\">Scrolling shadows</h2>\n<p>Around the time I originally published this idea, <strong>Lea Verou</strong> wrote about <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lea.verou.me/2012/04/background-attachment-local/\">Pure CSS scrolling shadows</a>. The shadows act as a visual indicator for content overflow and invite scrolling. Nicer than a hard cut-off in my opinion.</p>\n<p>I’ve found that <code>background-attachment: local</code> is unreliable on mobile devices. My alternate method works well enough to hide and reveal the shadows. I’ve commented the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://codepen.io/dbushell/full/8e6a1ee85418f3c5abe839647dbcdec5/\">CodePen</a> CSS to highlight the relevant styles.</p>\n",
