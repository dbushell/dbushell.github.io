The detail and focus around usability has resulting in one of my favourite website designs yet.</p>\n<p>Creating a consistent user interface was a big challenge and initial pencil &amp; paper wireframes were an important part of the process. A strong visual hierarchy ensured that the website worked at all sizes. The use of strong blues and wooden browns created an instantly recognisable brand.</p>\n<p>We decided to separate the mobile website to allow single focus on the main functionality; creating lists. This also allowed us to develop a very fast and bandwidth friendly site for mobile devices. The interface adjusts itself to take advantage of expected touchscreen behaviour.</p>\n<p>You can read more about my design process on my blog: <a href=\"https://dbushell.com/2011/03/14/designing-mylifelisted/\">Designing My Life Listed</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"/images/portfolio/web-design-mylifelisted-1.png\" alt=\"David Bushell - Web Design - My Life Listed home page.\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"/images/portfolio/web-design-mylifelisted-2.png\" alt=\"David Bushell - Web Design - My Life Listed sign up page.\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"p--small\">Design and front-end development by David Bushell at Base Creative</p>\n\n<p class=\"p--small\"><a href=\"http://www.mylifelisted.com\">Visit My Life Listed</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"p--small\">Website launched in March 2011</p>\n",
