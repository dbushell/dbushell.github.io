I wanted to get away from the cliché illustration style of most modern sci-fi books so I kept the designs very typographic. I printed on matt paper then screen-printed extra elements with a translucent pearlescent ink that shimmers on the surface. Typography choices are influenced by retro sci-fi like Buck Rogers and Asimov’s novels, as is the worn and torn aesthetic. This look contrasts with the pearl ink making the books look timeless.</p>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-lazy=\"false\" data-src=\"/images/portfolio/spaceopera1.png\" alt=\"David Bushell - Space Opera - The five final books.\"></p>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-lazy=\"false\" data-src=\"/images/portfolio/spaceopera3.png\" alt=\"David Bushell - Space Opera - Open spreads.\"></p>\n",
