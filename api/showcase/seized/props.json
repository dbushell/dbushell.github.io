Completed while on work placement at Thoughtful.</p>\n<p>Based around the Seized logo provided I’ve designed a leaflet, poster and billboard. The x-ray imagery illustrates the themes of smuggling, detective work, and surveillance. The blue tonal range flows through the compositions and contrasts with the yellow which creates some striking typography. The connected yellow circles &amp; lines represent the amazing stories in the gallery.</p>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-lazy=\"false\" data-src=\"/images/portfolio/seized1.png\" alt=\"David Bushell - Seized - Front and back of A4 leaflet.\"></p>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-lazy=\"false\" data-src=\"/images/portfolio/seized2.png\" alt=\"David Bushell - Seized - Inside of A4 leaflet.\"></p>\n",
