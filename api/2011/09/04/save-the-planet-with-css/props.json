It doesn’t make my content any less accessible, and it’s easy to bypass if you’re really, <em>really</em> set on printing.</p>\n<p>In truth though, it’s probably wise to really consider what can be printed. A lot of paper can be saved with a carefully crafted print.css.</p>\n<p>What do you think? <del>Maybe I should start a campaign?</del></p>\n<h3 id=\"update-\">Update!</h3>\n<p>I did it: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://printstylesheet.dbushell.com\">see printstylesheet.dbushell.com</a> and join the revolution!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://printstylesheet.dbushell.com/\"><p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-lazy=\"false\" data-src=\"/images/2011/09/printcss.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n</a></p>\n<p>Follow the discussion over at <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://forr.st/~wah\">Forrst</a></p>\n",
