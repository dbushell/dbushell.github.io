One of my favourite campaigns last year was <a href=\"http://www.saveaswwf.com/en/\">Save as WWF</a> — the PDF that can’t be printed, and that got me thinking.</p>\n<p>Here’s my new print.css:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token atrule\"><span class=\"token rule\">@media</span> only print</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token selector\">body *</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token property\">display</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> none <span class=\"token important\">!important</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token selector\">body:after</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token property\">content</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Don't waste paper!\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>I’ll be using something similar on my personal projects (where printing makes no sense). It doesn’t make my content any less accessible, and it’s easy to bypass if you’re really, <em>really</em> set on printing.</p>\n<p>In truth though, it’s probably wise to really consider what can be printed. A lot of paper can be saved with a carefully crafted print.css.</p>\n<p>What do you think? <del>Maybe I should start a campaign?</del></p>\n<h3 id=\"update-\">Update!</h3>\n<p>I did it: <a href=\"http://printstylesheet.dbushell.com\">see printstylesheet.dbushell.com</a> and join the revolution!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://printstylesheet.dbushell.com/\"><img src=\"/images/2011/09/printcss.png\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Follow the discussion over at <a href=\"http://forr.st/~wah\">Forrst</a></p>\n",
