I summed it up to this sentiment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Self promotion is not about pushing an ego onto others, it’s simply about making yourself visible and accessible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One thing I realised quickly in my career is the importance of having a consistent public profile. There’s no point running a Tumblr blog if no one associates it with you. When <strong>Google+</strong> launched a few weeks ago I registered my usual black &amp; white headshot and made sure to link <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/112664170427933857280/\">my profile</a> across the web—from Twitter to dbushell.com—BOOM! An extension to my online persona.</p>\n<h2 id=\"google-authorship\">Google Authorship</h2>\n<p>But a Google profile is more than your normal web presence:</p>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-lazy=\"false\" data-src=\"/images/2011/07/google-social-search.png\" alt=\"Google search for &quot;Circle me&quot; showing an author profile\"></p>\n<p>What you’re seeing in the first search result is the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=1229920\">Google Authorship</a> program in action. Because my blog links to my Google+ profile reciprocally, Google knows I’m the author of that page and shows my mugshot. With the right development I can link to my profile on every website I publish content for. See <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://imjustcreative.com/implementing-google-authorship-markup-on-your-website/2011/07/07/\">Graham Smith’s guide to Google Authorship</a> for a designer-friendly introduction.</p>\n<p>The second search result promotes a link I’ve shared as a +1 recommendation. (It happens to be my <em>other</em> blog linking to the same article, but that’s not the point!).</p>\n<h2 id=\"open-to-the-public\">Open to the Public</h2>\n<p>No hiding now! Promoting yourself online is a big commitment. With such a strong public profile it’s a dangerous game. There’s a level of professional integrity that can be easily damaged with poorly written criticism (or a drunken tweet).</p>\n<p>In reality though, the “privacy” of the past has always been an illusion. Whatever information I make public is just that; <strong>public</strong>. It doesn’t matter whether I whisper it in a friends ear or publish it online—it’s out there. For that reason I think this heightened level of online promotion will be a good thing. I’ll be far more conscious of what I make public and will wield a lot more power for self promotion.</p>\n<p>For those working in the web industry, is it possible to stay behind the curtain?</p>\n",
