Much overdue, and very useful for creating “web apps” where navigation bars are fixed to the viewport’s edge (top or bottom), allowing content to scroll naturally underneath.</p>\n<p>Some mobile bowsers already support this (see <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobilehtml5.org/\">Mobile HTML5</a> and <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://caniuse.com/#search=position\">When can I use…</a>) and all modern <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.quirksmode.org/css/contents.html\">desktop browsers</a> do (as you would probably expect).</p>\n<p>The term “web app” is rather irrelevant, a website is a <em>website</em>, though functionality based mobile — <em>ahem, small screen</em> — websites are where this fixed positioning technique can be handy; it replicates the design paradigm that many native apps employ.</p>\n<p>In the past we’ve had to either:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use JavaScript to regularly reposition elements accordingly based on the documents scroll offset (to keep them in view). Very noticeably laggy and thus unacceptable.</li>\n<li>Use <strong><code>position:absolute</code></strong> (top &amp; bottom) on all containing elements so that the document is never larger than the viewport, then re-implement scrolling on the main container with JavaScript and touch event listeners. This is <em>OK</em> — Google’s Ryan Fioravanti <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://code.google.com/mobile/articles/webapp_fixed_ui.html\">explains how</a> — but it does cause gotchas with form elements, and trying to re-implement the smooth, native scrolling of the iPhone seems silly.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The lack of fixed positioning in Mobile Safari is a real headache for creating web apps. Matteo Spinelli — <em>the developer of <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4\">iScroll</a></em> — knows this <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cubiq.org/ios5-the-first-true-web-app-ready-platform\">all too well</a>. He envisions a future where most “native apps” are simply wrappers for responsive websites. A distinctly advantageous method:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Web apps are much more than position:fixed or webGL. You can update them on the fly, build your own business model on them, ask for a subscription fee, have your users pay for additional features, or make them completely free.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And most importantly, the same app or website can be made accessible on all web devices, just like a good website should. There are many disadvantages of course, but those are for another article :)</p>\n<h2 id=\"maintaining-legacy-support\">Maintaining legacy support</h2>\n<p>Should we rejoice in the fact that iOS5 now supports <strong><code>position:fixed</code></strong>?</p>\n<p>Yes, but we’re not quite home free. We still have to support the non-upgraders, the pre-iOS5 users. The trouble is that there’s no easy way to check browser support for fixed positioning. Keep an eye on the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/167\">Modernizr discussion</a> for the latest developments.</p>\n<p>Once a trustworthy test is established we can start implementing the fixed positioning technique and use the old JavaScript method as a fallback. Let’s not forget older devices. Calling a website a “web app” does not make it excusable to only support one or two devices (in my opinion). We’re talking about graceful degradation as usual.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that iOS5 has also added support for <strong><code>overflow:scroll</code></strong> and <strong><code>-webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch</code></strong>, meaning that other native style interactions can be replicated a lot easier.</p>\n<p>I’ve designed and built <a href=\"/showcase/my-life-listed/\">mobile specific</a> websites before, as well as many more fully responsive websites. With techniques like this I can see a future where responsive website designs can deliver a natively styled and packaged “web app” that is also accessible on normal mobile &amp; desktop web browsing.</p>\n<p>A preferable future, I’m sure you’ll agree.</p>\n",
