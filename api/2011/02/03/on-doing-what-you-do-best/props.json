I’m also half way through writing my second article. (Despite being immensely tired from slogging out up to 14 hours of work daily over the last fortnight – ouch!)</p>\n<p>I have a big smile on my face knowing the efforts I’ve made in blogging have been rewarded with such an honour.</p>\n<p>I’ve wrote about <a href=\"/2010/07/12/on-design-blogging/\">why I blog</a> before (it’s not all self promotion!) but I never said how motivating it is for me. It is, and so are all the other projects and interests I work on. My main job in web design is just one of these interests. To explain, allow me to go back to the beginning…</p>\n<p>I fall into perhaps one of the last generations to remember a technology free childhood in the UK. To think that I didn’t learn from a computer until late in my education, and iPhone’s were science fiction. Some kids aspired to be Doctors, Astronauts and Firemen, but I could never have aspired to be a Web Designer because it didn’t exist.</p>\n<p>If I had aspirations, they lied in arts &amp; crafts and language.</p>\n<p>I wrote my first line of HTML three years before I set my career path towards being a Graphic Designer, and over 10 years before I would eventually commit to a career in Website Design. With hindsight it was always inevitable but at the time I had no idea where my future would take me.</p>\n<p><strong>I was simply following interests.</strong></p>\n<p>When I was younger I was often berated about lack of tangible goals in life. What teachers could never understand and what I could never articulate was that following my interests <em>was</em> my goal. I didn’t care about which pencils I’d be qualified to push. Who would?</p>\n<p>I believe that unless you follow what you’re interested in, you’ll never be happy in life.</p>\n<p>Today I’m exceedingly happy :-D</p>\n",
