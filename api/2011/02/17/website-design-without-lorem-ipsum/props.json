Here’s three reasons why:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Design looks more professional and bespoke. You’re probably charging the client a lot more than the cost of a stock template, so don’t make it look like one.</li>\n<li>It forces you to acquire a deeper understanding of the client’s business. To design <em>their website</em> you should be able to quickly write sample headlines, navigation, and micro-copy specific to them (not necessarily good copy – but relevant copy). Not only does this help you nail the design, but is also impresses the client and ensures their confidence in you.</li>\n<li>Considering words is important. Sometimes they will be long and if the final content doesn’t fit into your design – that’s your fault. There are always reasonable limitations to content length. With a design that considers this from the start the boundaries will be understood and worked around by both designer and client.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These benefits are invaluable to a successful project. Any misunderstanding of the brief and client are caught <em>early</em>. It’s perfectly fine to clear things up in the first design meeting, it’s not so good when the website is being built and populated.</p>\n<p>I still use Lorem Ipsum from time to time. It’s useful for showing large paragraph designs like a blog post (where writing the whole thing would be silly). I just make a point of testing the design through extremes of short and long content.</p>\n<p>Do <strong>you</strong> design with Lorem Ipsum? Leave a comment! Let me know your experience.</p>\n",
