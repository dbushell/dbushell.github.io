On one hand, this blog will allow its authors to understand their own discipline, but more importantly, it will allow others a new perspective on what design can mean.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As expected it’s had a very positive reception, and why wouldn’t it? Nothing helps us more in design than studying the approach of others. <strong>xheight</strong> is focusing on theory over practical techniques which for some is a difficult concept to grasp. Their loss!</p>\n<p>Keep an eye out because there are some great designers lined up to share their ideas. I’m very grateful to all who are participating – thanks guys!</p>\n<p>Oh, and follow <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twitter.com/xheightblog\">@xheightblog</a>.</p>\n",
