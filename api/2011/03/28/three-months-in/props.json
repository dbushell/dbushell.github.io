I’m no longer interested in just designing websites for clients and clients’ clients. I’m doing all that, <em>and</em> I’m pushing it further; looking for opportunities to use new web technologies to provide a better experience. Even if only for a single device or situation.</p>\n<p>It can be a difficult judgement because a feature should not exist just for the sake of it – and definitely not for the ‘<em>wow-factor</em>‘. I’m a very strong believer that design serves a strict purpose and my design style reflects that (see <a href=\"https://dbushell.com/2011/01/16/reflecting-on-aesthetics/\">Reflecting on Aesthetics</a>). Despite restraint it’s impossible not to get excited about what web browsers can do nowadays. With things like audio &amp; video APIs, device orientation and the good old JavaScript revival, how can I not be blinded from the original purpose of websites I design?</p>\n<p>Is the trick to design a ‘standard’ website, then carefully sprinkle on some ‘HTML5’ like the dusting of a Victoria sponge?</p>\n<p>I don’t think that’s good enough.</p>\n<p>But that isn’t a revolutionary thought, I must concede. No one can really describe how to design a website because there is not a single correct process, nor is there a single correct solution. There are techniques, but mostly it’s personal preference. What matters is the knowledge of identifying a good website design when you see one (including your own).</p>\n<p>Back to the topic of modern websites. Before I ‘design’, I consider the website’s users and the tasks they need to achieve, and those they’re being asked to perform. This could be anything from simple information finding to highly engaged interactivity. I then plan the perfect work-flow, and design around that.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicity is priority.</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes simplicity <em>does</em> involve jQuery and HTML5 APIs—but more often than not—it is a single, perfectly placed hyperlink.</p>\n<p>A quote from Kenya Hara’s book <em>Designing Design</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The future lies ahead of us, but behind us there is also a great accumulation of history – a resource for imagination and creativity. I think we call “creative” that dynamism of intellectual conception that flows back and forth between the future and the past.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<p>Those working in graphic design know this all too well, but sometimes I think web designers forget their past. It’s worth remembering that XHTML 2.0 was scrapped in favour of HTML5; a standard designed on top of what <em>already existed</em>.</p>\n<p>Designing for the future does not mean ignoring what we already know.</p>\n",
