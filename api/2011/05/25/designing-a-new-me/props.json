It’s obvious really, why would people visit unless you have some substance? They’re so important that design should focus on layout and architecture and only then should aesthetics be considered.</p>\n<h2 id=\"its-refreshing\">It’s refreshing!</h2>\n<p>I’ve had <strong>dbushell.com</strong> online for 7 years and it’s gone through 5 iterations. My personal brand has been a slow evolution, I’ve presented my portfolio first and foremost because that defines me. Over the years I’ve allowed a few aesthetic elements to slip in (namely “green”) but it’s still about what I produce.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"/2010/06/26/dbushell-v4/\">previous update</a> back in June ‘10 made blogging that bit easy (and I’ve done a <em>lot</em> of blogging since).</p>\n<h4 id=\"old-and-busted\">Old and busted:</h4>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-lazy=\"false\" data-src=\"/images/2011/05/dbushellcomv4.jpg\" alt=\"dbushell.com version 4\"></p>\n<h4 id=\"new-hotness\">New hotness:</h4>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-lazy=\"false\" data-src=\"/images/2011/05/dbushellcomv5.jpg\" alt=\"dbushell.com version 5\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-new-this-time\">What’s new this time?</h2>\n<p>A few things annoyed me about the old design. Really annoyed me. The “logo” was <em>huge</em> and stole too much attention without serving much purpose. The new one is slicker and seriously vintage (guaranteed airtime).</p>\n<p>My mascot—the green crane—is now facing <em>inwards</em>. I should have paid more attention in my university’s semiotics lecture. I only realised after translating a Chinese design blogger who had featured me. Thank you, whoever you are!</p>\n<p>I’ve embraced the sponsors. I joined the brilliant <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://carbonads.com\">Carbon Ads</a> network a few months ago and had to shoehorn the ads in the best I could. The result wasn’t good enough and it couldn’t be fixed easily. My new design with the u-dark header seats the ads perfectly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"its-responsive\">It’s responsive!</h3>\n<p>I’ve preached about responsive web design for long enough. The term is redundant, web design <em>is</em> responsive design. Previously I experimented with a few multi-column varied-width blog templates but now my whole website is fluid.</p>\n<p>I’ve built up from a <em>min-width</em> of <strong>320px</strong> to a <em>max-width</em> of <strong>1140px</strong> with media queries to adjust layout for several steps upward. A lot of people don’t set bounds but it’s a nice touch to avoid silly extremes. <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://github.com/scottjehl/respond\">Respond.js</a> is magic.</p>\n<p>Most of my blog layouts remain the same, they just fits more intelligently now. I’ve also cleaned up a lot of HTML—<em>but don’t look yet</em> I’ve still a bit to tidy! My <a href=\"/showcase/my-life-listed/\">portfolio pages</a> are going “high-def” with powerful visuals and I’ll be adding more recent projects very soon.</p>\n<h3 id=\"perfection\">Perfection?</h3>\n<p>Unlikely! But I’m satisfied for now. Leave a comment below. Tell me what you think :) As always I’ll be realigning things for months to come. There are a few WordPress issues I need to iron out. Damn you WP!</p>\n<p>Almost everything I’ve implemented here has come from months of experimentation and evolving design practices working at <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.basecreative.eu\">Base Creative</a>. We’ve got some amazing projects going live soon. If you want to work with me – that’s where I am!</p>\n<p>Oh, and for comparison here’s version 3. Notice the similarities?</p>\n<p><a href=\"/images/2011/05/dbushellv3.jpg\"><p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-lazy=\"false\" data-src=\"/images/2011/05/dbushellv3-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"dbushell.com version 3\"></p>\n</a></p>\n<p class=\"p--small u-dim\">Thanks to <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.minimalsites.com/david-bushell\">Minimal Sites</a> for saving that screenshot!</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lovedsgn.com/post/6554\">Love</a></p>\n",
