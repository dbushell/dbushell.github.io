Hope I can say more soon! In the meantime, here’s a little web app I’m launching this week - <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kwib.it\">Kwibit</a> - it has a tagline that goes something like this <em>“collect and share your moments of inspiration”</em>.</p>\n<p>Things are so busy right now I’m losing track of days but that’s all good. Currently reading <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hardboiledwebdesign.com/samples/\">Hardboiled Web Design</a>. I was reluctant to buy it after feeling a bit empty finishing other much-tweeted about web dev books, but after the first few chapters I’m loving the style and even more so the message.</p>\n<p>I’m a little annoyed after copying the PDF to my Kindle. In fit-to-screen mode the text is far to small. Zooming means the page gets chopped in half vertically. I guess that’s hardboiled design! Any Kindle pros know if you can separate the text and drop the graphics/grid layout? Leave a comment!</p>\n<p>By the way, if you’re wondering what happened to my font design project I lost the rhythm and decided to put it on hold.</p>\n<p>My <strong>Link of the Month</strong> (a new feature sponsored by <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://designheroes.co.uk\">Design Heroes</a>) is <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wordmark.it/\">Wordmark.it</a> - if you understand what it does you’ll cry with joy, I did.</p>\n<p>Happy January folks!</p>\n",
