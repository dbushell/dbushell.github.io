I’m just going to link to <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://shiflett.org/blog/2012/mar/ideas-of-march\">Chris Shiflett’s 2012 update</a>.</p>\n<p>I believe I’m suppose to write about <em>writing</em>. When I started this blog in 2008 post-graduation it began as a tiny link hidden away in the footer of my portfolio website. I couldn’t write back then. Now, five years on, I’ve become exceedingly efficient at it (if you’ll excuse the Matrix quote) and this blog has <em>become</em> my website. That’s not to suggest I’ve gotten any better at writing (obviously), only that I’ve become more prolific.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-do-i-write-about\">What Do I Write About?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/2010/07/12/on-design-blogging/\">I blog</a> because it exercises my mind. It forces me to think deeper and it allows me to share ideas and things that I’ve learnt.</p>\n<p>I can knock out a thousand words before breakfast. A nice skill to have but one with many downsides. Primarily: I have more drafted posts than published ones. Only after I’ve tried to write about something do I realise how much I truly know. I think a lot of people would benefit from analysing the ideas they’ve expressed; they’ll probably come to a similar conclusion.</p>\n<p>That is one reason why I write about some topics and not others.</p>\n<p>I try to avoid preaching “best practices”, only techniques I find useful (though I’m sure there’s evidence to suggest otherwise). I like to share my experiences related to my career; you can’t beat a conference write-up. But above all, <strong>I never comment on industry-centric issues</strong>. Professionalism, elitism, sexism. I do not write about these things. It’s not that I don’t have opinions or interests — I do — it’s just that I’d rather concern myself with other, more positive topics. That doesn’t mean I choose to remain ignorant and shun any responsibility I may have as a fellow website maker, only that I choose not to share my thoughts on <em>the Web</em>.</p>\n<p>I rarely blog about myself either — the “me” outside of the web designer &amp; front-end developer. I have an account but I don’t use Facebook. I login maybe twice a year. I use Twitter strictly for “business” (though the occasional banal tweet is unavoidable). I simply have no desire to share my life online.</p>\n<p>I know I’m not normal in that respect.</p>\n<p>For kids these days the Web runs parallel to the physical world — a dimension where culture is not yet censored by man-made borders. A place where expression and sharing is encouraged and publicness is default. For people born into both worlds it’s understandable why the digital one is so exciting, so addictive. I belong to perhaps the last generation who can remember growing up <em>without</em> the Internet. I did, however, adopt it early and at a very young age. I made websites, I continued with over half a decade of education, and then I went back to making websites. Everyday I witness how powerful the Internet has become in shaping our future. Everyday I contribute to <em>building</em> part it.</p>\n<p>Yet for me there is a disconnect.</p>\n<p>As much as the Web fascinates me it also bores me. The more it draws me in the more I think about what is left behind: a world that I probably know <em>less</em> about. A world less explored. I guess that is why I only blog about website production. If I were to write about anything else I’d start to drift away from the keyboard.</p>\n",
