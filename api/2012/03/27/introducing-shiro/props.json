When I redesigned my <a href=\"/2012/03/03/forget-about-browser-support/\">personal website</a> I had a large list of “required” standards to see the optimal version. That’s cool; my audience is on the cutting edge of browser tech. I wasn’t too worried about delivering complex layout to old versions of IE. Our latest project at <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.browserlondon.com/\">Browser</a> sees an audience that is almost <strong>50% Internet Explorer —</strong> and a great many lower than version 8. (I spat my coffee out too.)</p>\n<p>We’ve designed a bold visual style that looks very modern but won’t depend on any fancy CSS. Great, but what about layout? Producing a basic linear format for such a large percentage of visitors isn’t the “best possible experience” I like to take about. I’ve been working on a solution…</p>\n<h2 id=\"hello-shiro\">Hello Shiro</h2>\n<p>To solve this little conundrum I’ve been experimenting with a basic responsive grid that can transform into a fixed-width layout in IE6–8 (which don’t support media queries). All with a tiny 1000 byte JavaScript shim. Shiro is a building block for your mobile-first build, it won’t fix further IE bugs but it’s a nice start.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://shiro.dbushell.com/\">Visit the Shiro preview</a> and have a hack around.</p>\n<p>Here’s what it looks like in IE6:</p>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-lazy=\"false\" data-src=\"/images/2012/03/shiro-ie6.png\" alt=\"Shiro in IE6\"></p>\n<p>PS, I will be dogfooding this in the coming weeks so expect updates!</p>\n",
