Their logic behind this seems simple enough; developing for IE users did not equate to profit.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Supporting variants of IE can easily increase design work by 30% to 100%, but complex features can easily double (or even triple) development time. It doesn’t take many developer salaries before this “IE tax” can cost you well over $100,000.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Aside from profit, other benefits listed were: employee satisfaction, productivity, and shorter release cycles.</p>\n<p>Open Web evangelists will rage at this idea. Accessibility for all is a cornerstone of good website development. The phrase “best view in…” keeps rearing its ugly head. The idea of “only viewable in…” is even worse.</p>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-lazy=\"false\" data-src=\"/images/2012/04/Screen-shot-2012-04-02-at-14.00.51.png\" alt=\"4ormat sign-up IE blocked\"></p>\n<p>There are two precedents that I find very worrying here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/2012/03/03/forget-about-browser-support/\">Browser support</a> should never be boolean. Except when the number of potential users is minuscule (e.g. IE 6 in most cases), at which point testing is clearly unprofitable. A tiered visual and functional experience based on feature detection should exist, i.e. progressive enhancement. Any individual browser or device accessing a website is irrelevant in regards to “support”; there are just <em>too many</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Internet Explorer is not that difficult to develop for.</strong> Sure, IE is the butt of all jokes, but the reality is a competent front-end developer should be able to deliver something accessible (based on point 1 above). If IE “doubles” or “triples” your development time then consider hiring new developers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ultimately, website owners can do what they choose. I think an idea like actively blocking Internet Explorer is stupid but it’s not my business decision to make.</p>\n<p>It does, however, set a dangerous example to those who make websites.</p>\n<p>If you’re a so-called <em>website designer</em> or <em>website developer</em> then stop bitching. <strong>Learn to do your job</strong>. It’s irresponsible towards your employer to project such a negative light on one browser just because you lack the skills to do your job properly.</p>\n<p>Rather than whining like a baby when you’re pulled out of your cosy Apple eco-system full of Webkit-based browsers and high resolution devices, face the real world. Recognise that a little bit of hard work and less fun goes a long, long way.</p>\n",
