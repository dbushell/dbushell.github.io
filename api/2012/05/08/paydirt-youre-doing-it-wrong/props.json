It screams of bad practice. Don’t talk to me about “costs” involved in supporting certain browsers; <em>your doing it wrong</em>. The whole concept of “browser support” is a dangerous perspective to take. I’ve blogged about it before: <a href=\"http://dbushell.com/2012/03/03/forget-about-browser-support/\">Browser Support? Forget it!</a> Today’s Chrome is tomorrow’s IE6. If you’re thinking in terms of all-or-nothing you’re ignorant of how the Web works.</p>\n<p>Take a <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/understandingprogressiveenhancement/\">progressive enhancement</a> approach. Use feature detection to offer a granular level of experience; remain agnostic of device and browser.</p>\n<p>“IE support” — or support for any browser — is a side-effect of these methods, not something that drains extra time or money. Such an approach makes it <em>easer</em> to take full advantage of the latest hotness. You’re laying accessible foundations to build great things upon. Don’t shroud your ineptitude as a developer with claims like, <em>“We don’t spend hours debugging obscure IE bugs, and we spend that time making real improvements for sensible browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera”</em>. IE is not the problem, you are. You’re approach is backwards to begin with.</p>\n<p>The Web is not the ‘Webkit Web’ or the ‘Firefox Web’, it’s not the ‘mobile Web’ or the ‘iPad Retina Web’ — it’s <strong>the Web</strong>. The minute your forget that you’re doing it wrong.</p>\n<p>And at the end of the day, if you don’t give a hoot about potential users, why actively block them? Your site probably <a href=\"http://blog.reybango.com/2012/05/08/hey-paydirt-your-site-works-just-fine-in-ie/\">works anyway</a>.</p>\n",
