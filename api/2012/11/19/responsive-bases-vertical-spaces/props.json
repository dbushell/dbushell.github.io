In theory this isn’t complicated. Just make all vertical spacing a multiple of your line-height. Not that easy in practice. Responsive images and videos — anything with a fluid width and aspect ratio — break the baseline. Trying to maintain it regardless is a headache.</p>\n<p>Personally I just don’t agree it’s worth the hassle. Keep a baseline within textual content areas of course, but across the whole layout? Don’t sweat it. Arrange by eye. Or better yet, why not do it <em>responsively</em>?</p>\n<h2 id=\"responsive-heights\">Responsive Heights</h2>\n<p>Watch the demo video below and you’ll see what I mean.</p>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/53866112?badge=0&color=ffffff\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"605\" height=\"340\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Responsive design on two dimensions. And terrible screen recording, apologies for that but I hope it illustrates the point. This is the first prototype of a website we’re building at <a href=\"http://www.browserlondon.com\">Browser</a> that will go live next year. I’ll keep you updated. There’s a lot of experimentation to follow.</p>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"/images/2012/11/vertical-spacing.png\" alt=\"Vertical spacing with CSS vh units\"></p>\n\n<p>I define all vertical height, margins, and padding as one would do normally, then I progressively enhance with <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#viewport-relative-lengths\">viewport-percentage units</a> — e.g. <code>10vh</code> being equal to 10% of the viewport height. <a href=\"http://modernizr.com/\">Modernizr</a> provides the hook (it’s a “none-core” detect), but you can just write two declarations with the fallback first. Web browsers ignore the second if unsupported.</p>\n<p>In the demo above I’m using JavaScript to scale the headline text a la <a href=\"http://fittextjs.com/\">FitText.js</a> but you could potentially use viewport units to achieve this.</p>\n<p>For further tuning use<strong> min/max-height</strong> to limit the range, or scope the style with <strong>height-based media queries</strong>. In my opinion these techniques are massively under-explored. Show me what you can do!</p>\n<p>Of the <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#search=vh\">supporting browsers</a> Internet Explorer 9 worked without issue. Chrome seems to occasionally fail to repaint on viewport resize. Not a huge issue, I’m considering forcing a repaint with a little bit of JavaScript. iOS 6 faired much worse when I tested on the new iPhone. Not only did viewport resize/rotate fail to repaint properly, but the initial values seemed arbitrarily way off. If I can figure out what’s going on there I’ll post an update. For now I’m doing device detection to remove feature detection, lovely!</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-reading-\">More Reading…</h2>\n<p>Naturally, Chris Coyier already has an existing demo taking this further with full <a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/\">Viewport Sized Typography</a>.
