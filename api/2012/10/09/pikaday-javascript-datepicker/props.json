Normally we can safely use new web standards with the knowledge that non-supporting browsers will simply ignore them, or we can use <a href=\"/2012/03/03/forget-about-browser-support/\">feature detection</a> to progressively enhance the experience. With the state of the new input types however, this unfortunately means polyfill-only for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p><strong>Pikaday <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dbushell.github.com/Pikaday/\">demo</a> and <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/dbushell/Pikaday\">source</a> on GitHub.</strong></p>\n<p>What’s wrong with the ubiquitous <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/\">jQuery UI datepicker</a>? This little guy has been my go-to widget for many years. Trouble is the dependencies are very heavy; 50kb+ of JavaScript (minified and compressed), and several image requests. jQuery UI is great (and <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.jqueryui.com/2012/10/jquery-ui-1-9-0/\">very much alive</a>) but to me it feels like an all-or-nothing commitment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pikaday is packed below 5kb</strong> and isn’t even dependent on jQuery. It does play well with <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://momentjs.com/\">Moment.js</a> if you need advanced formatting. This datepicker has literally been on my “projects to build” list for <em>years</em>. I’ve seen alternatives since but nothing I’ve been happy to develop further.</p>\n<p>What’s next? Please report any bugs and feature requests on the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/dbushell/Pikaday/issues\">GitHub issue tracker</a>. I’m working on date range and time selection. I’ll likely ship it on a live website soon and announce a production-ready version.</p>\n<p>(This project has delayed my <a href=\"/2012/09/30/groundhog-day/\">redesign</a> but rest assured it’ll happen soon!)</p>\n",
