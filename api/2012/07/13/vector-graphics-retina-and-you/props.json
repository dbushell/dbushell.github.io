Brady (@thomasqbrady) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thomasqbrady/status/223121090698940419\">July 11, 2012</a></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>A classic conference soundbite with zero context. On face value it’s ridiculous:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>CSS is not a “vector-based drawing tool”.</li>\n<li>Making vector illustrations with “pure CSS” is <a href=\"http://farukat.es/journal/2010/08/469-pure-css-icons-make-madness-stop\">madness</a> for the very reason that;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dbushell.com/2012/04/03/svg-use-it-already/\">SVG</a> is <em>the</em> standard for vector-based drawing in the browser today.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But thinking about the quote further, this literal translation (of possibly poor paraphrasing) is not what Luke Wroblewski actually meant. At least I hope not, I wasn’t at the conference. How live tweeters expect anyone to understand a 140 character snippet of a 20–60 minute talk I’ll never know. What I hope Luke was referring to was that the advances in CSS allow us to replicate complex UI designs and other visual elements with CSS alone, where 9-slicing bitmap graphics was once a norm. This is excellent for making resolution independent websites, and it leads me nicely onto my second rant:</p>\n<h2 id=\"are_-you_-retina-ready-\">Are_ You_ Retina-ready?</h2>\n<p>Am I the only person who takes issue with a brand/trademark being used to describe a generic technical concern? I’m starting to find it nauseating to see “Retina” when the author really means “high pixel density”. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_independence\">Resolution Independence</a> is our goal. “Retina” panders to expensive pop-culture gadgets and loses all context of the rich history software developers have had tackling the subject. While I’ll accept that genericised trademarks inevitably evolve — think Photoshop, Google, Xerox, Hoover, Aspirin — the Retina epidemic is leading to a lack of understanding; a care towards the bigger picture. It breeds an attitude of glorifying Apple and vilifying competitors. It evokes genuine suggestions that we should all <a href=\"http://www.netmagazine.com/news/do-web-designers-need-retina-display-122067\">buy £2000 laptops</a> — when was the last time you tested an ‘out of date’ CRT monitor? It turns you into a slave of 20th century commercialism and reinforces not only a mono-culture, but the idea — <em>“why can’t we all just play nice and use Webkit browsers?”</em> — that a mono-culture is a <em>good</em> thing.</p>\n<p>I know it’s a terminology battle I’ll never win, but if there’s one thing I want you to take away from this article it’s that there is life beyond your own preferences. Understanding and embracing this fact will make you a better website developer.</p>\n",
