Very honoured to be in the line-up. I’ll be partaking in a quick fire 20 minute presentation with Q&amp;A afterwards. I’m super excited because if I had my way, this would be the topic of every conference (probably a good thing I don’t get my own way).</p>\n<p>It’ll be a while before I finalise my 20 minutes (haven’t started yet), but it’s a sure bet I’ll be showing off responsive techniques for common/advanced design patterns. I’ll demo the principles and keep the code light (you can inspect that online later).</p>\n<p>If you’re heading to Brighton <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twitter.com/dbushell\">give me a shout</a>. I’ll certainly try to accomodate any specific design/build questions.</p>\n<p>If you’re wondering what my credentials are my focus for the last two years has been <a href=\"/2012/06/17/passenger-focus-responsive-web-design-case-study/\">making</a>, <a href=\"/?s=responsive\">blogging</a>, and selling to clients all things responsive/device-independent.</p>\n",
