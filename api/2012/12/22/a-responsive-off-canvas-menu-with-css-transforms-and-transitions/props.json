The general idea is nothing new. It lacks accessible foundations and unfortunately, as many have fed back, there are rendering issues that cause flickering in some browsers.</p>\n<p>This is part of my research for an upcoming <strong>Smashing Magazine</strong> article and my talk at <a href=\"/2012/12/07/responsive-day-out/\">Responsive Day Out</a>. In both I’ll be examining design patterns we can use to improve <strong>responsive design</strong> and silence the critics.</p>\n<p>We need to embrace the viewport and do more than stack content vertically; one very long scroll is no better UX than a zoomed out, fixed-width format.</p>\n<p>To take responsive design — or simply web design — into new territory we need sound implementation; hence the experimentation above. More to come! For now I’ll point to Siddharth Rao’s article on <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/css3-vs-jquery-animations/\">CSS3 vs jQuery Animations</a> and Brad Frost’s <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bradfrost.github.com/this-is-responsive/patterns.html\">Responsive Patterns</a> for further inspiration.</p>\n<p>See you next year!</p>\n",
