As with all web development anything older than a few months is likely a bit dated. Browser support will vary but tested to my satisfaction for at least one project<sup>†</sup>. That’s at least all modern browsers with a graceful fallback in older IE.</p>\n<p class=\"p--small u-dim\"><sup>†</sup> not a guarantee.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to share an improvement – fork away! Or leave a comment. Please use the CodePen comments so others’ can learn from you. I may or may not update older snippets. Some may become irrelevant as CSS specs develop.</p>\n<p>This isn’t a polished portfolio. Just raw code. But if I do have time I will try to pretty things up. Any superfluous, non-functional CSS will be kept separate.</p>\n<p>This new collection exists for two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I keep solving the same problem over and over again because I can’t remember what websites I’ve worked on.</li>\n<li>Highly focused code demos are my most popular content.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I encourage all front-end devs to do something similar. We have to feed those insatiable *”how do I…”* Google and StackOverflow searches!</p>\n<p>Follow <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/dbushell\">@dbushell</a> for updates.</p>\n",
