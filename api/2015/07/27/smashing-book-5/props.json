This time was different, they all sounded fascinating — and they were! I read the book cover to cover in two sittings.</p>\n<p class=\"p--light p--small\">Disclaimer: I was given the book for free with no strings attached. I’m under no obligation to review the book or write kind words, these are my genuine opinions.</p>\n\n<p>As with all books in the series, this book collates the red hot topics that are defining front-end development in 2015 and the foreseeable future. The content is conference level of quality in detail, research, and delivery (and I’ve seen many of the authors speak).</p>\n<p>I’ll highlight a few chapters I see myself referencing often:</p>\n<p>In “Performance Optimization Roadmap”, <strong>Vitaly Friedman</strong> recalls the on-going development of <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/\">smashingmagazine.com</a> since its 2012 redesign. It’s one thing to preach best practices, but to implement them with limited resources on a website of such scale is challenging (to say the least!)</p>\n<p><strong>Sara Soueidan</strong> has written an outstanding reference for SVG usage in her chapter: “Mastering SVG For RWD And Beyond”. I honestly thought I knew it all but even I learnt a new technique. If you’re not using SVG yet this chapter will set you on the path.</p>\n<p>In “Building Responsive Components With Flexbox”, <strong>Zoe M. Gillenwater</strong> covers many real-world use cases for Flexbox whilst documenting the technical details. Flexbox is impressively versatile for implementing responsive layout. Again, if you’re not familiar with the spec — and importantly, what it can do — start your journey here.</p>\n<p>It’s not often I read a book twice but I’ll definitely be going back to re-read these chapters. They’re packed.</p>\n<p>So, good book? Yes, very good!</p>\n",
