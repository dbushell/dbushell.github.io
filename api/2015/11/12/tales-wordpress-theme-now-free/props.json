Or at least, that seemed to be the sentiment and it certainly looked painful for me. Rather than dealing with it I simply stopped selling Tales.</p>\n<p>I haven’t been keeping up to date with the whole EU VAT thing but I did notice one of my selling platforms — <a href=\"http://blog.gumroad.com/post/110080508463/vat\">Gumroad</a> — now takes the burden. So I could start flogging again, but a year on, I feel it’s now appropriate to give away the theme for free without offending the handful of lovely buyers who supported my project.</p>\n<p>I don’t expect many people to use Tales in production but it might suit as a simple example of a sellable theme if you’re looking to get into that kind of development.</p>\n<h2 id=\"download-tales\">Download Tales</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://themes.dbushell.com/tales/\">Visit the Tales website to see a demo and download the theme.</a></strong></p>\n<p>I can’t provide free support but the site linked above has plenty of documentation for authors and developers.</p>\n",
