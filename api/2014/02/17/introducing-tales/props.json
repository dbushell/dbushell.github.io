That project is called <a href=\"http://themes.dbushell.com/tales/\">Tales</a> and it’s available today.</p>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><a href=\"http://themes.dbushell.com/tales/\"><img src=\"/images/2014/02/tales-preview-large.png\" alt=\"Tales WordPress theme preview\"></a></p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://themes.dbushell.com/tales/\">Tales</a></strong> is a responsive WordPress theme tailored for a beautiful reading experience. Its strength and design principle can be summed up in one word; simplicity. Visit the <a href=\"http://themes.dbushell.com/tales-demo/\">Tales Demo</a> website to see a basic install in action.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typography\">Typography</h2>\n<p>What makes Tales so special? First and foremost the theme has been designed with an unwavering focus on content and readability. Tales CSS makes use of <code>em</code> units for all sizing and media queries. This ensures font size honours the user defined browser setting and everything scales proportionally (see: <a href=\"http://blog.cloudfour.com/the-ems-have-it-proportional-media-queries-ftw/\">“The EMs have it”</a>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"mobile-and-legacy-browsers\">Mobile and Legacy Browsers</h2>\n<p>Tales has been built on solid foundations. A top notch experience is in store for the latest browsers. More importantly older versions like <strong>IE7</strong>, <strong>iOS 3.0</strong>, and <strong>Android 2.2</strong> aren’t far of the pace.</p>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"/images/2014/02/tales-mobile-devices.jpg\" alt=\"Tales WordPress theme across mobile devices\"></p>\n\n<p>And my all time favourite browser, Internet Explorer 7:</p>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"/images/2014/02/tales-in-ie7.png\" alt=\"Tales WordPress theme in IE7\"></p>\n\n<p>Not too shabby, right?</p>\n<h2 id=\"responsive-design\">Responsive Design</h2>\n<p>There’s not a great deal to write about here that you can’t <a href=\"http://themes.dbushell.com/tales/\">see for yourself</a>. The style of navigation is a notable choice. I decided to go fixed and off-canvas to give unity across all devices. I find it works very well for Tales’ blog format where long, individual pages views are common.</p>\n<p>The design aligns to two complimentary grids and a loose baseline within the main content. Five major breakpoints were used to adapt to screen size.</p>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"/images/2014/02/tales-grid-desktop.png\" alt=\"Tales WordPress theme grid design\"></p>\n\n<p>Like what you see?
