At my old workplace I dual-wielded 24” monitors. Since then I’ve adapted to a single 13” MacBook Air for my desktop set-up. For a while it was claustrophobic but given a few months I became adept at juggling applications.</p>\n<p>Despite adapting it never <em>quite</em> felt comfortable. So after saving enough pennies, I’ve created the best of both worlds, A.K.A., the classic freelancer set-up:</p>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-lazy=\"false\" data-src=\"/images/2014/06/new-desktop.jpg\" alt=\"My laptop and monitor set-up\"></p>\n<p>I’m giving this arrangement a few weeks. I think I’ll prefer it over the side by side. (See why below — and yes that is a mighty Logitech B100 mouse, I spare no expense!)</p>\n<p>Out of the box it was an odd experience browsing the web once more at this scale. The resolution is larger: 1920×1080 vs 1440×900, but the pixel density is lower: 92.56 vs 127.68 PPI — Dell U2414H vs MacBook Air respectively.</p>\n<p>Number are confusing but what they effectively mean is that the same website, or anything for that matter, appears visually <em>larger</em> on my new monitor.</p>\n<p>This relationship between the physical size of a screen and its resolution is easy to forget when you’ve been working on one device for so long.</p>\n<p>It is noticeable when working with extremes, i.e. a mobile phone and a desktop monitor, but because a design can be so different at these breakpoints the solution is often over-simplified (e.g. a separate CSS stylesheet for small ‘mobile’ devices). It’s also complicated by yet another factor: the screen’s distance from our eyes.</p>\n<p>See <strong>Oliver Reichenstein’s</strong> article on <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ia.net/blog/responsive-typography-the-basics/\">“Responsive Typography: The Basics”</a> for a thorough look into this effect.</p>\n<p>We can do our best to design responsively using sensible defaults, media queries, and generous assumptions, but we’ll be forever at the mercy of elbows and office chairs. A user-defined setting we can’t override (and that’s a good thing).</p>\n<p>My set-up with the laptop closer to me therefore seems like the most natural arrangement. It helps reduce the difference and keeps text in my line of sight at a readable size. A side by side arrangement would force too much refocusing. I’ll see how it goes! It may turn out worse for my posture.</p>\n<p>Now if only I can get the damn colours to match…</p>\n<p>*[PPI]: pixels per inch</p>\n",
