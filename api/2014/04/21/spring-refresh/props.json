It was large and a little out-dated. I work independently, my name and face are my brand alongside my design aesthetic, so why do I need a logo too?</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"/showcase/origami-unfolded/\">origami crane</a> is another signature image. One that’s more attractive, versatile, and a piece of my design portfolio I’m especially fond of. Allowing this to become the primary visual focus has given my home page a new beautiful simplicity.</p>\n<p>Practically speaking the logo was unwieldy to design around. If an unimaginative person were to write <em>“The Laws of Web Design”</em> one might state <em>“the logo must appear in the top-left corner”</em>. Such boring convention encourages an equally unimaginative masthead to follow suit. By freeing myself of these constraints I became open to much more experimental ideas.</p>\n<h2 id=\"readable-content\">Readable Content</h2>\n<p>I adapted the fixed header concept I first developed for my <a href=\"/2014/02/17/introducing-tales/\">Tales WordPress theme</a>. It provides instant access to navigation and a subtle reminder of who I am. Importantly, it doesn’t dominate the top of every page. On larger viewports the website footer becomes a fixed sidebar off to the right. This brings my profile and recent content into view while allowing the current page to lead.</p>\n<p>Whilst tidying my web server the other day I noticed that my <a href=\"/origami.html\">original portfolio</a> from 2008 is still online. Look at how tiny that text is! My eyesight has no doubt deteriorated since, but my respect and understanding for web accessibility has increased at a far greater pace. With each iteration of my website I’ve strived to improve typography and reduce content density. I reckon this is my best iteration yet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coming-soon\">Coming Soon…</h2>\n<p>I’m still waiting for a few websites to launch before I update my <a href=\"/showcase/\">design portfolio</a> with more recent responsive case studies. I’m hoping for a big summer update.</p>\n<p>I’m also writing a front-end dev review to cover technical aspects of my new website. Expect that sooner!</p>\n",
