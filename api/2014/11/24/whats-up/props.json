I’m not a fan of “out of office” auto responders, so please don’t be offended if you don’t receive a reply until January. At which time I’ll be delighted to discuss new work :)</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"silence\">Silence</h2>\n<p>Anyway, as you might have noticed this is my first post in a little while. A strict blogging schedule doesn’t inspire me. I’ve always found something interesting to say, at least, until recently. These last few months of silence have broken a five year blogging spree.</p>\n<p>I’m tweeting less too… what’s up? When it comes to keeping up to date with the industry I haven’t been making the same efforts I used to. Most of my favourite email newsletters are unjustly getting the “mark as read” sentence. And as for attending events; I’ve been absent for far too many.</p>\n<p>But I am freelancing hard! Great projects, great clients. Work to be proud of. Just not much that can be succinctly blogged about. (Or freely talked about, for that matter.) I guess that’s the nature of being a coder for hire.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reflection\">Reflection</h2>\n<p>I’ve identified my “problem” as twofold:</p>\n<p>Primarily, I’ve realised that I need to focus on web <em>design</em> for smaller businesses. These are projects where I can take the lead and make a real difference.</p>\n<p>Projects and new ideas worth writing about.</p>\n<p>While I enjoy helping out agencies as a front-end developer — something I’m rather good at — the disconnect with the client isn’t conducive to ideation at my end. By jumping in and out of a project it’s hard to feel ownership of the parts I produce. Realistically though, this type of work is my bread and butter. I very much appreciate these opportunities and will continue taking them next year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/2014/06/02/work-as-a-freelancer/\">I need to be more pro-active</a> when looking for my own clients. I knew that already, it’s just easy to forget after long runs of coding.</p>\n<p>Secondly, my content and “social media” input has stagnated. I used to subscribe to a new RSS feed weekly. I even curated my own. Nowadays, I feel a bit out of the loop. I can’t pinpoint exactly when this changed. Maybe I got lazy. Maybe I got lost when people declared RSS “dead”. What I have noticed this year is that many hot topics within the web industry have been overwhelmingly negative. Perhaps that’s why I’ve taken a step back. I need to refocus on the good things. About time for a new side project too, I think.</p>\n<p>On the whole though it’s been a good year. I really can’t complain!</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-break\">A break</h2>\n<p>So like I said, once I’ve finished up current work I’ll be taking what’s left of December away from the web. A couple week’s holiday for sure, but also time to plan my freelance career going into the new year.</p>\n<p>Have a good one, and see you soon!</p>\n",
