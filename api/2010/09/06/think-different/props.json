Ping is completely walled off. Why it doesn’t have a web interface I have no idea. It’s social without the riff-raff. Or Apple-friendly mainstream artists without the indie bands.</p>\n<p>The problem with the interface of iTunes Store &amp; Ping is that by all accounts it generally sucks (ignoring Steve’s opinion). It doesn’t behave or interact in the same way as a website. But it _should _be a website. Instead it’s confusing, fiddly, tedious, awkward; proprietary nonsense. <strong>Now that is thinking differently.</strong></p>\n<p>To quote Apple on HTML5:</p>\n<blockquote><p>These web standards are open, reliable, highly secure, and efficient. They allow web designers and developers to create advanced graphics, typography, animations, and transitions. <strong>Standards aren’t add-ons to the web. They are the web.</strong> And you can start using them today.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<p><strong>“Standards aren’t add-ons to the web. They are the web.”</strong> But apparently not good enough for iTunes and Ping? I guess those two are just add-ons then. Only available in certain countries.</p>\n<p>Good job Apple make awesome ads.</p>\n<p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to play Angry Birds on my iPhone. For four hours.</p>\n",
