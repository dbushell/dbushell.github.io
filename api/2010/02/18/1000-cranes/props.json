I only folded one, but it’s brought me good luck so far.”</p>\n\n\n<p>I don’t know how, but I must have decided that was a challenge to myself:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dbushell/4367894897/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2801/4367894897_f7cd69c256.jpg\" alt=\"Day 49 (Thursday 18-02-2010)\"></a></p>\n<p>evidently.</p>\n<p>Now, I don’t back down from a personal challenge, and if I get this done I’ll finally be able to remove that cheesy quote from my home page. The <em>real</em> kicker here is that I could have sworn this paper was 7 inches when I ordered it, not 7 <em>centimetres</em>. These things are barely bigger than the Queen’s head.</p>\n<p>And I’ve got 1000 to make!</p>\n<p>Wish me luck!</p>\n<h3 id=\"update-21st-february\">Update! 21st February</h3>\n<p>Here’s a pic from yesterday, since then I’ve completed a total of 33 cranes. I’ve now decided to work in stages as it’s easier to repeat the same folds over and over and over again, which results in more accuracy. Stage 1 is a square base (<a href=\"http://www.oriland.com/oriversity/basefolds/main.asp\">more info here</a>) of which I have about 100. Stage 2 is the bird base - around 20. Projected finish date: hopefully before I die.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dbushell/4375960887/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4001/4375960887_18de2bd862.jpg\" alt=\"Day 51 (Saturday 20-02-2010)\"></a></p>\n",
