The <em>real</em> kicker here is that I could have sworn this paper was 7 inches when I ordered it, not 7 <em>centimetres</em>.

I’ve now decided to work in stages as it’s easier to repeat the same folds over and over and over again, which results in more accuracy. Stage 1 is a square base (<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.oriland.com/oriversity/basefolds/main.asp\">more info here</a>) of which I have about 100. Stage 2 is the bird base - around 20. Projected finish date: hopefully before I die.</p>\n<p>[<em>photo was lost to time…</em>]</p>\n",
