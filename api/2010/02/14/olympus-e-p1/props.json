Both use the new <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Four_Thirds_system\">Micro Four Thirds</a> system which means a large sensor and interchangeable lenses, but without the bulk of a digital SLR.

This is replaced by a 3” LCD screen on the back.</p>\n<p>I chose the E-P1 over the other option(s) mainly because it looks retro and totally bad-ass (didn’t say I actually knew anything about cameras). From a weekend of testing I’m very pleased with the results. The E-P1 is a perfect camera for the weekend tourist/hobbyist photographer and weekday graphic designer, like me!
