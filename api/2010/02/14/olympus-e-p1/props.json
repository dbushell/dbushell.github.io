Both use the new <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Four_Thirds_system\">Micro Four Thirds</a> system which means a large sensor and interchangeable lenses, but without the bulk of a digital SLR.

This is replaced by a 3” LCD screen on the back.</p>\n<p>I chose the E-P1 over the other option(s) mainly because it looks retro and totally bad-ass (didn’t say I actually knew anything about cameras). From a weekend of testing I’m very pleased with the results. The E-P1 is a perfect camera for the weekend tourist/hobbyist photographer and weekday graphic designer, like me! My new friends agree:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dbushell/4355853159/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4015/4355853159_354971a0ff.jpg\" alt=\"(Day 45) Goat at Mudchute Farm #1\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dbushell/4355852675/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4064/4355852675_3c72df944f.jpg\" alt=\"Goat at Mudchute Farm #2\"></a></p>\n",
