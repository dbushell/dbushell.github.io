It has served me very well in those occasions where I can remember a resource or piece of design I want to reference but have no idea where it is. The old design worked great for that but it wasn’t very accessible to other people, so I decided to redesign it.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://designheroes.co.uk\"><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-lazy=\"false\" data-src=\"/images/blog/dh-update.png\" alt=\"no description\"></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"new-design\">New Design</h3>\n<p>The new site retains the idea of “tag filtering” but is initially presented in a more recognisable blog format. The big different is a large image assigned to every bookmark. To maintain a minimalist feel, various elements are hidden and can fade in when needed. Let me know what you think!</p>\n<p>Another cool feature I added is navigation by arrow keys (up/down). The final big change is the ability to post a comment on each bookmark. Hopefully this will make the site a lot more engaging.</p>\n<p>And finally, <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twitter.com/dsgnheroes\">Design Heroes is on twitter!</a> So go follow.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://designheroes.co.uk\">http://designheroes.co.uk</a></p>\n",
