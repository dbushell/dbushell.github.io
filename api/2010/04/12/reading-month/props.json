I read books, of course!</p>\n<h3 id=\"logo-design-love\">Logo Design Love</h3>\n<p>My area of work (web design) generally starts with some kind of existing branding of the client. Sometimes I do get the odd chance to create a brand from scratch, but certainly not enough to keep my logo design skills finely tuned.</p>\n<p><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-lazy=\"false\" data-src=\"/images/blog/logo-design-love-book.jpg\" alt=\"Logo Design Love - a guide to creating iconic brand identities\"></p>\n<p>To compensate I tend to browse a lot of design blogs including <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.logodesignlove.com\">Logo Design Love</a> - run by <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.davidairey.com\">David Airey</a>. The <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.logodesignlovebook.com/\">book</a> _”Logo Design Love - A Guide to Creating Iconic Brand Identities” _was released earlier this year and it filled one of my Mac-less weeks very nicely.</p>\n<p>This book is excellent!</p>\n<p>My design library (or shelf to be more accurate) comprises around 70% of the books I was recommended during my University days. I really wish this book was published back then. It’s a great introduction to the whole process of designing a logo. But it’s not just for beginners, with David Airey’s experience there are enough snippets of knowledge in the book to give anyone an enlightened smile.</p>\n<p>I especially liked the many case studies and examples that are used to illustrate the ideas and processes being discussed. The book is fairly short and can be read in a couple of sittings, but this isn’t a bad thing - every paragraph is insightful - there’s no waffle here! That makes it very easy to remember. Airey does a very good job of describing the sort of design knowledge you can only “learn from experience”, such as communicating with clients.</p>\n<p>If you’re a design student, or a post-graduate who’s a couple of years into your first job (like me!) or even a seasoned pro, I can’t think of a reason why you shouldn’t buy this book. Learning from a proven design expert is priceless!</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Logo-Design-Love-Creating-Identities/dp/0321660765/\">So go buy it!</a></p>\n",
