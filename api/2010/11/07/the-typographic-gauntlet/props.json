I think I’ve done about 100 so far (having folded nothing since March). Some may say I set the bar too high on that one. I say nonsense! I’m just postponing the challenge until I have a particularly unlucky year.</p>\n<p class=\"small\">(My daily photo project also failed but let’s just forget about that one too…)</p>\n\n<p>Back to this new challenge – I’ll be designing a new font every 8<em>ish</em> weeks giving me a deadline of the New Year for font #1. They’ll be entirely different designs. No typeface with weight variations. I’ll be tackling serifs, sans-serifs, mono-spaces, erm… slabs, serifs, everything. Neo-grotesque.</p>\n<p>As proof I’ll be publishing a special online poster &amp; blog post with the actual font embedded using a bit of CSS3 magic. I make no promise of legibility, but I do hope at least a few of my fonts turn out surprisingly decent. And if that’s the case I’ll flog them for a good price.</p>\n<p>I’ve got my pencil and Helvetica Moleskine at hand so wish me luck!</p>\n<p>If you think I’m mad or want to join me in this challenge leave a comment below.</p>\n",
