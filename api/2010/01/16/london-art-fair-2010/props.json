Last night I had a brief moment to sneak round the <a href=\"http://www.londonartfair.co.uk/\">London Art Fair</a> at the Business Design Centre. I work inside the BDC so there wasn’t much of an excuse for missing it, although I did my best with the amount of design briefs on my desk this week.</p>\n<p>Anyway, here’s my favourite pieces from the show. I guess it says a lot for my taste in “art”. In graphic and web design I like clarity and functionality. In “art” I’m a firm appreciator of technical skill, creativity, humour and impact. For me to like a piece of art it has to have at least 2 of those 4 qualities. Thankfully that doesn’t limit my tastes to any particular art movement or style. I’ll take modern or the masters. But that doesn’t mean I’m going to nod my head deep in thought while you talk at me about the wanky nuances of the canvas you ruined.</p>\n<p>Here are six pieces that stood out for me at the London Art Fair. There was so much more I wish I’d photographed though, but I wasn’t sure of the etiquette of constantly holding an iPhone at arms length. The shows on till Sunday, go visit!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dbushell/4278766176/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2803/4278766176_8d8bd93018.jpg\" alt=\"London Art Fair #1\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dbushell/4278766910/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4072/4278766910_94a9876bed.jpg\" alt=\"London Art Fair #2\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dbushell/4278019109/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4035/4278019109_957b1bdcd6.jpg\" alt=\"London Art Fair #3\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dbushell/4278019591/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4030/4278019591_e74f4d39fc.jpg\" alt=\"London Art Fair #4\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dbushell/4278020277/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2728/4278020277_df5792ab57.jpg\" alt=\"London Art Fair #5\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dbushell/4278019861/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2553/4278019861_2fe48f6136.jpg\" alt=\"London Art Fair #6\"></a></p>\n",
