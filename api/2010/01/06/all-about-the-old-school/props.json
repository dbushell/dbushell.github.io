I’d take ads like this anyday over the rubbish that’s literally shouted at us on today’s TV. Ok, so the tobacco ad above probably isn’t the best example, but compared to contemporary ads I’d still call it elegant and sophisticated.</p>\n<p>Mini-rant over and on to the next link:</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-movie-title-stills-collection\">The Movie Title Stills Collection</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.annyas.com/screenshots/\">The Movie title stills collection</a> does what it says on the tin.

I’ve (hopefully) snapped up a few tickets. Check out the trailer below:</p>\n<p>The St Bride screening is on the 21st January. Check back here for a field report!
