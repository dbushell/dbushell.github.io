Blogging in general takes aaaaages. I’ve found however that this isn’t so time consuming. Artworking the photo and uploading it never takes more than 10-20 minutes. Trying to find a good photo is challenging, but 24 hours is a long time to look around.</p>\n<p>Looking around is the key. Open your eyes to the world around you. Sorry, that’s horribly cliché. I think I wrote something a month or so ago about how “creatives” look at things differently. That’s especially true for photographers. I don’t call myself a photographer, but I know what makes a good photo. This week I’ve been seeing photos everywhere. I nearly walked under a bus the other day, trying to mentally crop a better angle.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-retrospective\">In Retrospective</h3>\n<p>It’s going to be interesting (at least personally) what my year will look like. My memory of events has always sucked so a day-by-day will be fun to review. I’ve been thinking of what sort of compilation I’ll make in the end. Maybe a photo diary, bit boring? Some interactive Flash gallery? That’s so last decade. Guess I’ll figure it out in 2011.</p>\n<p>That’s enough for now. Still shooting with my iPhone. Can I bring myself to splash out on a DSLR?</p>\n",
