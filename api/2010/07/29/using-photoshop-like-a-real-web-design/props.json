I didn’t contribute much to the question because the answer is <strong>obviously yes</strong>, but I did think long and hard about my own practices.</p>\n<p>Today Smashing Magazine published a great article by Thomas Giannattasio, <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/07/29/in-defense-of-photoshop/\"><em>“In Defense of Photoshop”</em></a>. He raises the point that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Photoshop can be used to create impeccable designs, but after hours of hard work, you end up with a static mock-up that is incapable of emulating the experience one gets when the design is converted to mark-up and viewed in the browser.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And this would be my main point if I were to articulate an argument on why web designers should be able to code. Simply put, if you can’t code and don’t understand HTML and CSS - <strong>you are not designing a website</strong>.</p>\n<p>In the article linked above Giannattasio makes an excellent feature suggestion for Photoshop allowing users to <em>‘shop</em> semantically closer to the DOM and CSS properties available. I don’t know why Adobe haven’t been innovating features like this for years. It would definitely aid those ‘<em>web designers</em>‘ who can’t code. It would simplfy things for pros too but in truth a professional web designer should be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep a running mental visualisation of the DOM as the design evolves.</li>\n<li>Understand the limitations of HTML/CSS and browser quirks.</li>\n<li>Know exactly what mark-up and styling will be needed to create each element.</li>\n<li>Know exactly how raster images will be implemented.</li>\n<li>Know exactly how the page is going to flow and transform at different resolutions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you can’t do these things you are not designing a website. <strong>Don’t blame the tools.</strong> While the CSS idea in Photoshop could be helpful it isn’t necessary (or relevant to the software). You should already know what techniques to use to mimic CSS (hint: <em>blending options</em>, not <em>filters</em>).</p>\n<p>There are many comments on Giannattasio’s article suggesting that ‘design’ should be an entirely different step to ‘development’. From the clients point of view this is true but from a production point of view it doesn’t really matter. If you know how to build a website you can design one freely in whatever software suits you.</p>\n<p><strong>Understand development and you can realise greater potential with design.</strong></p>\n",
