After completing a very solid year in my pro web design career, 2010 was suppose to be all about exploring past passions in art and crafts. Replacing the mouse with a paint brush and all that nonsense.</p>\n<p>I was stoked, so naturally January &amp; Feb turned into the worst months of my otherwise healthy life. Not to delve into personal details but it was a very demoralising time.</p>\n<p><strong>But I recovered!</strong> <sup>yey!</sup></p>\n<p>I was back in the game, and it was now about <strong>web design and development</strong>. Screw the paintbrush it doesn’t support JavaScript half as well as Chrome.</p>\n<p>A refreshing <strong>April</strong> appears on the horizon and I build my first <strong>HTML5</strong> website with a re-design of <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://designheroes.co.uk\">Design Heroes</a>. Give me a few months and I’ll be crushing the next-gen web standards like a pro, but for now I’m eyes deep in W3 specifications.</p>\n<p><strong>June</strong> sees the return of an old nemesis: WordPress. My desire to blog more requires it be as easy as possible, a <a href=\"/2010/06/26/dbushell-v4/\">re-design of dbushell.com</a> on WordPress leaves no excuse. The new design has been very well received, and I’m honoured by the hundreds of design blogs that have featured me to date.</p>\n<p><strong>Summer</strong> goes by fast and my design blogging goes up a notch. I should mention I’ve been working at <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.basecreative.eu\">Base Creative</a> all year if you were wondering what’s happened in between!</p>\n<p>Around <strong>August</strong> I start thinking there should be some kind of “coffee break” website for designers to chill out between client work. That little idea evolved into my most successful project yet. <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lovedsgn.com\">LoveDsgn</a> is a bit of a runaway train, but it’s also amazing to work on, and the community has been passionate and inspiring.</p>\n<p>Right now I’m focused on a very exciting project at Base Creative. Can’t say more, but I can <em>not</em> wait to see it live early next year!</p>\n<p>A lot of my side projects have fallen by the wayside throughout the year. Not by choice but by demands elsewhere. I think my tweet yesterday sums it up - <em>“The day I go to bed feeling there’s nothing more to be done is the day I give up.”</em></p>\n<p>I don’t know which projects will resurface, but since I’ve already acquired domain names for a few, I suspect it will be those :-) Am I going to make predictions for 2011?</p>\n<p>No!</p>\n<p>But I am excited for what is in store. Enough about me, how has your year been?</p>\n",
