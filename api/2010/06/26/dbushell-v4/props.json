My old design has served me very well over the last year - it was featured on quite a few design blogs. But it was looking a bit dated.</p>\n<h3 id=\"habari-to-wordpress\">Habari to WordPress</h3>\n<p>When I designed my website last year I rebuilt it entirely on the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://habariproject.org/en/\">Habari</a> blogging platform. Habari destroys WordPress in many areas (probably most) but the lack of documentation makes it very inaccessible for non-programmers. So after a heated debate with myself I reluctantly installed WordPress 3. I suppose it really isn’t that bad. The minimalist inside me cries at the amount of unnecessary HTML and CSS that WordPress loves to chug out by default. Sure I can go in and change that stuff, but trying to do anything the <em>non-wordpress-way</em> is an exercise more annoying than vuvuzela band practice.</p>\n<p>I had immense fun trying to keep all my old URLs the same. Hope Google likes it. I may return to Habari one day, but for now I’m back with the crowd.</p>\n<h3 id=\"web-standards\">Web Standards</h3>\n<p>The new design takes full advantage of CSS3, especially @font-face embedding. Say hello to <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Droid-Serif/\">Droid Serif</a> (now one of my top five typefaces), and <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/7-league-gothic\">League Gothic</a> (because who doesn’t like it?). There’s some fancy stuff going on in the forms too - I’ve yet to test this in IE though! I’m just glad I’ve got rid of Cufon.</p>\n<h3 id=\"logo-thingy\">Logo thingy</h3>\n<p>I’m calling it a logo thingy because it isn’t quite a logo. I don’t need a logo. I haven’t had one during the last 4 years my site has been live. Anyway it’s full of modern cliches so I’m sure it’ll change at some point down the line.  It did get a fairly positive reception on twitter and <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dribbble.com/players/dbushell\">Dribbble</a> so for now it can sit up there.</p>\n<h3 id=\"design-and-layout\">Design and Layout</h3>\n<p>A big reason for the redesign was getting my blog and portfolio pages more unified. I’ve reduced the clutter and kept it simple. A good tip for any designer is don’t be too ambitious! Less is more (as they say), but more importantly - less means less to maintain. I’ll probably be adding to my portfolio soon (I have actually been working for the last two years you know). Any maybe a bit more CSS flare to come.</p>\n<p>So what do you think? Leave a comment below if you like the changes, or if you dont!</p>\n",
