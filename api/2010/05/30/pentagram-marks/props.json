The cover is double folded card with a matt finish in red. I’m not going to guess a Pantone but from an artistic point of view I can see hints of blue in there. Not to get too hung up on the red but it’s obviously been carefully chosen.</p>\n<p>The title is set in <strong>Pentagram’s</strong> logo font which I believe is <em>AT Modern Twenty</em> after a few googles. The word “Marks” is printed in the slightly-blueish-red tinted slightly lighter and also subtlety debossed, which adds a bit of class.</p>\n<p>The spine is perfectly minimalist, perfect bound, sans-serif, even the publishes logo looks good. The back cover is the pure red paper stock with a small white barcode sticker in the bottom right corner. This is also a nice touch.</p>\n<p>With the exception of the single page introduction the 400 pages consist of a logo centre stage, and bottom right: <em>organisation</em> (bold), <em>year</em> [of design], <em>description of organisation</em>. The layout is simple and does the job. It’s by no means a “classic” but it’s not over-designed either. Simplicity in design is hard to master. There are no page numbers, any questionable necessity would not justify their overshadowing presence on the page. I can imagine hours of debate over the smallest layout decision. Either that, or knowing those crafty Pentagram partners they probably knocked it up in 2 hours (show offs!).</p>\n<p>There are a couple of other interesting things to note. The logos are ordered alphabetically ascending by organisation name. I would have initially expected chronological order, but the more I think about it I’m beginning to agree with this choice. Logos should be timeless so suggesting “old” and “new” is unimportant. And now I realise exactly <em>why</em> this book doesn’t need page numbers. You’re only ever going to be referencing a particular logo from its name.</p>\n<p>Another point of note is the lack of a “designer” attribute. We are therefore forced to see *<em>Pentagram *</em>as a single entity, and not a collective of ever changing partners.</p>\n<p>The logos are presented in black and white:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Isolating them in black and white helps us appreciate these marks as unique formal solutions, and highlights the contrasts and occasional similarities among them.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To suggest that all 400 logos are classics of design would be rather silly. Some of the logos are downright awful. But then you flick past the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/\">V&amp;A</a> logo you understand why Pentagram has published their own logo book. There are a few pleasant touches, such as Puffin Books and Penguin Books facing each other on facing pages. No sloppy editing here.</p>\n<p>I should note this is a review of the mass print paperback version. The limited 1000 print edition is at least twice as lovely.
