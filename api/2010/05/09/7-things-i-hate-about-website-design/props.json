  "innerHTML": "<p>Website Design and Development!</p>\n<p>I started writing a blog about all the cool things being a web designer has to offer, i.e. ever changing technologies (slicker browsers, screens with pixels pushed closer together, HTML5, CSS3 with shadows and rounded corners everywhere etc). But then I figured people have already done a better job than I could write on a Sunday afternoon, so I’m going to write the opposite. And it’s easy to moan.</p>\n<p><strong>I am in a good mood by the way this is a bit of a fake rant. But anyway, in no particular order of rage - I present 7 things I hate about web design and development:</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"7-thing\">#7 thing</h3>\n<p><strong>Favicons.</strong> 16 by 16 pixels what is this 1995?</p>\n<p class=\"p--small u-dim\">Rage rating: 5/10 - annoying but not much of a deal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-thing\">#6 thing</h3>\n<p><strong>The “page-fold”.</strong> So at what arbitrary point do you fold your monitor?</p>\n<p class=\"p--small u-dim\">Rage rating: 10/10 - is there some sort of secret society that I’m not invited to?</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-thing\">#5 thing</h3>\n<p><strong>Adobe Flash</strong>. It’s the new IE6 - deprecated but impossible to kill. It’s sad because I know Flash and ActionScript like the back of my hand. Despite what people say Flash deserves a massive handshake for what it provided. Namely streaming video on sites like YouTube and BBC iPlayer. But now Flash is like that really fun guy at a party who has gotten progressively drunker and abusive and should have left a <em>loooong</em> time ago. Let HTML5 have the dance floor.</p>\n<p class=\"p--small u-dim\">Rage rating: 6/10 - rising.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-thing\">#4 thing</h3>\n<p><strong>“Copy of copy of layer 1”</strong>. My Photoshop layers are as unorganised as everyone else but I really <em>really</em> <strong>really</strong> hate the default naming scheme Adobe uses. Seeing “copy of” just makes me so angry. It’s like nails on a blackboard, someone incessantly poking you, and OCD all in one.</p>\n<p class=\"p--small u-dim\">Rage rating: 8/10 - like a pulsating headache.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-thing\">#3 thing</h3>\n<p>The <strong>“font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;”</strong> default font stack. Arial is what happens when Microsoft doesn’t want to pay royalties for Helvetica so they buy a poor mans version. It’s almost the same, just a few subtle differences, all for the worse. Arial is packaged with Windows and Mac OS. That’s probably 99% of your traffic so why not just do <strong>“font-family: Arial;”</strong>. Or give your typography appreciative visitors a treat and go with <strong>“font-family: Helvetica, Arial;”</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"p--small u-dim\">Rage rating: 4/10 - No one will notice either way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-thing\">#2 thing</h3>\n<p><strong>Font rendering</strong>. Photoshop provides 4 different anti aliasing settings non of which replicate the horrendous mess most modern browsers produce. Have you ever tried using @font-face embedded text with a drop shadow? My Nintendo 64 could produce smoother edges.</p>\n<p class=\"p--small u-dim\">Rage rating: 9/10 - always ends in disappointment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-thing\">#1 thing</h3>\n<p><strong>“p { font-size: 10px; }”</strong> I’ll have to admit when I first started designing websites back when I was like 12, my eyes were 20/20 and my CRT looked like a chess board. Nowadays pixels are a tad denser and trying to read 12px text is like reading the ingredients off a chewing gum wrapper. 12px or lower is fine for minor things but never a good choice for body copy. And oh man don’t get me started on 12/12px line-height and 5000 character line length.</p>\n<p class=\"p--small u-dim\">Rage rating: 3/10 - who am I kidding, I wasn’t going to read that anyway.</p>\n<p>There! Glad I got that off my chest.</p>\n<p>What makes you Hulk out? Leave a comment below!</p>\n",
