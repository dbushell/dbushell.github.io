So I decided to sacrifice a lunch break to see the product, furniture and miscellaneous design categories week.</p>\n<p>Here’s six things I liked.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/new-designers/origami.jpg\" alt=\"Origami\">\nEvery portfolio needs an origami crane. Preferably green though.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/new-designers/fabric.jpg\" alt=\"Fabric\">\nThis curtain-like thing was very cool. Looks like it could be morphed into any shape.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/new-designers/books.jpg\" alt=\"Books\">\nIt’s tempting to ask a printer to quote for this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/new-designers/glass.jpg\" alt=\"Glass\">\nI didn’t think they literally meant glass, but here we are. A lot more eye catching in person when you look through at different angles.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/new-designers/chairs.jpg\" alt=\"Chairs\">\nThese look really comfortable.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/new-designers/elephant.jpg\" alt=\"Elephant\">\nVery novel. One of the few things there that I can see selling.</p>\n",
