I see them and slow moving, pondering figures as if they’re in some kind off purgatory. The sense of emotion is very powerful, is it coincidence most of these figures are looking/walking towards the light? It’s as if time has stopped still and they are exploring the deepest of thoughts.</p>\n<p>The mix of cartoon styled beings and realistic light and shadow really do create something to marvel over. The lighting very much reflects Chughtai’s background in film sets.
