The points seemed to have been hit worse than the pound in the “current economic climate” but enjoyably I did see this great book display (pictured below).</p>\n<p>Space Opera is a series of classic Sci-Fi books republished with designs from a D&amp;AD student competition. These are completely different to my entries but are very nice indeed.

I’m slightly glad now that I didn’t win the competition because my wallet would certainly be a whole lot lighter tonight.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/showcase/space-opera/\">See my Space Opera books »</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/waterstones-spaceopera.jpg\" alt=\"Space Opera book display at Waterstones\"></p>\n",
