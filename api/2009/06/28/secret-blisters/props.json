I was expecting a good night but the showcase was incredible. Thankfully it was cash-only because there were several prints I had my eye on and my debit card would have taken a big hit for the team. I walked away with just the one print that will soon be framed and replacing the Ikea clone above my bed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/images/blog/secret-blisters/sb-01.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/blog/secret-blisters/sb-thumb-01.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a><a href=\"/images/blog/secret-blisters/sb-02.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/blog/secret-blisters/sb-thumb-02.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a><a href=\"/images/blog/secret-blisters/sb-03.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/blog/secret-blisters/sb-thumb-03.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a><a href=\"/images/blog/secret-blisters/sb-04.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/blog/secret-blisters/sb-thumb-04.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a><a href=\"/images/blog/secret-blisters/sb-05.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/blog/secret-blisters/sb-thumb-05.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a><a href=\"/images/blog/secret-blisters/sb-06.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/blog/secret-blisters/sb-thumb-06.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p class=\"quote\">We are bringing together a mixture of 35 emerging and established illustrators from pen to mouse to those who cover walls, for another summer bonanza of hand pulled, screen printed posters.</p>\n\n\n<p>For more information see the <a href=\"http://www.printclublondon.com/secretblisters_info.php\">Print Club London</a> website.
