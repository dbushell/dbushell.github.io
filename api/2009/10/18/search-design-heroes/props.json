Design Heroes is normally browsed by selecting the tags (listed on the left-hand side) but I think a search will be useful sometimes. For example, search for “David” and you’ll find me! I don’t think I deserve my own tag though :) The keyword(s) you enter are searched for within the bookmark titles and descriptions.</p>\n<p>Search will remain in the “Extras” tab until it’s been tested properly and fully integrated. I’m working on a more intuitive interface. I’m also looking at AJAX-ing the whole thing, if I find time.</p>\n<p>Anyway it’s Sunday afternoon and Man City are losing so I have somewhere else to be!</p>\n",
