Just add a line of code to your page and get it working in minutes. Simple, fast and standard-compliant.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-it-differ-from-typekit\">How does it differ from Typekit?</h3>\n<p>The main difference I see is that the font isn’t provided through JavaScript embedding. Rather a version of the font is hosted for you, as well as a specific CSS file that you link in your HTML document. This would suggest the original font file would be a lot easier to obtain (if you were inclined  to do such a thing.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“since about 95% of the font information is removed, even if the file is pirated, it only contains 5% of the font”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another difference to note is that unlike Typekit this is not a subscription service. You are paying a one-off license fee. You are also paying a <strong>monthly bandwidth fee</strong>. They do however provide the initial 500mb per-month for free, and then charge €1 per gigabyte after that. So not too shabby for a 20kb file. They host on Amazon’s cloud service which is safe to assume fairly reliable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-is-this-good-news\">Why is this good news?</h3>\n<p>Well at the moment the whole web-font-license issue is cloudier than an English autumn. It’s great to see the Typotheque foundry leading the charge for clarity by making a stance with what they offer - and on the face of it, it looks like a very fair and value-for-money service. They don’t limit on usage across multiple domains either.</p>\n<p>Let’s hope more foundries follow suit.</p>\n",
