The command line text editor notorious for hiding the exit door.</p>\n<p>I’ve been on a mission this week to learn it. I began by setting up\n<a href=\"https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim\">Vundle</a> to manage plugins.\nI added a few syntaxes, <a href=\"https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline\">Airline</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim\">CtrlP</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive\">Fugitive</a>, and the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme\">Dracula</a> colour scheme which I’ve\ncustomised a bit.</p>\n<p>I’ve realised it’s going to take a lot of use for me to become comfortable in Vim.\nKeyboard shortcuts have never been my friend. The difference in file browsing\nhas also thrown me off my game. It’s not that the command line and CtrlP are\ndifficult, it’s how accustomed I’ve grown to a file tree sidebar. I’ve\nsince found <a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree\">NERDTree</a> which I’ve\nbound to <code>Ctrl+n</code>. It alleviates a lot of pain.</p>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"/images/blog/dbushell-vim-editing.png\" alt=\"Editing dbushell.com in\nVim\"></p>\n\n<p>Despite the struggles I do like using Vim. I don’t see it replacing\nSublime Text 3 for long sessions. At least not any time soon. But it is now my\ngo-to for quick edits.</p>\n<p>If you have any favoured Vim tips, tweet me a link <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dbushell\">@dbushell</a>!</p>\n",
