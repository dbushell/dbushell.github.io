In fact, with the exception of a terrible two days flirting with Backbone, I’ve have none.</p>\n<p>What exists in the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/\">Ember Guides</a> is very good but far from complete as you’d expect from such a new technology. <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/emberjs/data\">Ember Data</a> is still under development so little documentation exists. For someone who has ‘designer’ written on his business cards; this is <em>very</em> slow learning. StackOverflow has rescued me many times. <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://emberwatch.com/\">Ember Watch</a> is also an excellent resource. Progress may be glacial, but I’m moving forward. <strong>Macaque</strong> is far from complete but you see the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/dbushell/Macaque\">code on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"experimental\">Experimental</h2>\n<p>Although I’m kind of ad-libbing this entire thing, I’m keen to tie in several project methodologies. I started with a half-hearted attempt at agile user stories (<em>user can use to-do app</em>). Unsurprisingly, it’s transpired that development is now meandering through whatever aspects of Ember I happen to figure out. This evolutionary approach isn’t quite what I had in mind. Once I feel more comfortable with Ember I’ll take a step back and refocus the project scope.</p>\n<p>This process is very good for <a href=\"/2012/09/17/agile-website-design-and-development/\">agile design</a>. Right now I’m letting development lead the experience and making design decisions as and when required. That’s not much right now, which is a good thing. I’m not over committing to style or interaction that could prove impossible later (or ill-advised). It may be a simple concept but designing whilst actually <em>using</em> the app is a lot better than designing from imagination alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Update: Part 4 —</strong> <a href=\"/2013/04/25/ember-data-and-mongodb/\">Ember Data and MongoDB</a></p>\n",
