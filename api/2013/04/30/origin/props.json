This year I started to consolidate everything into my own personal boilerplate to kick start front-end development.</p>\n<p>“Origin” is my code name for this on-going project (everything needs a name). It’s not a behemoth of code like <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/\">Bootstrap</a> or <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://foundation.zurb.com/\">Foundation</a>. It’s specifically tailored to suit the websites I make. It will never be complete and it will evolve dramatically as my preferences and needs change.</p>\n<p>This is not a framework I expect others to use ‘as is’ but I decided to make it public because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A lot of people asked kindly</li>\n<li>I learn from similar projects by other developers</li>\n<li>It will serve as a reference point when discussing particular techniques</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you care to poke around the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/dbushell/dbushell-Origin\">code is on GitHub</a>. Or you can see the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dbushell.github.io/dbushell-Origin/\">GitHub page</a> for my starting <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dbushell.github.io/dbushell-Origin/origin.html\">pattern library</a>. This doesn’t include everything I consider a “best practice” and a lot of things aren’t commented. Make of it as you will — just please don’t include it in a <em>“10 new resources for developers”</em> blog post!</p>\n<p>If you like the idea of automated builds and need a mature Grunt workflow then give <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://yeoman.io/\">Yeoman</a> a test drive. For a BEM-style CSS framework there’s <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css\">Inuit.css</a>. And if you need to prototype something fast, Bootstrap and Foundation have their uses.</p>\n",
