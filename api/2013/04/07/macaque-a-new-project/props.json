I’m keeping the features stupidly simple because there is already so much to consider.</p>\n<h2 id=\"starting-point\">Starting point</h2>\n<p>I’ve played with Node before but I’m starting Ember development with a blank slate. This weekend I’ve been casually introducing myself.</p>\n<p>While I dived into Ember routes and templates I threw together a quick <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expressjs.com/\">Express</a> app to serve fake API data. I feel comfortable with that now. I can see a list of tasks! The next step is add, edit, and delete functionality. That means going back to data storage and a real API. I want to do this quickly because it’s not my main interest.</p>\n<h2 id=\"moving-forward\">Moving forward</h2>\n<p>Once the API is ready I’ll return to Ember and implement the functionality. For UI design I’ll start with either <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/\">Bootstrap</a> or <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://foundation.zurb.com/\">Foundation</a> so it’s not ugly. I’ll be designing the final interface as I learn Ember and will eventually throw out the framework and rebuild the HTML &amp; CSS from scratch. The interaction design I’m envisioning will require advanced Ember concepts (I expect) so it will be useful to having a basic version in place first.</p>\n<p>I plan to publish everything under the MIT license prior to implementing my advanced design. I think it will be a helpful review project for future beginners.</p>\n<p>And if I get that far? I’m plotting the heinous crime of parcelling the website in a native Android wrapper and installing it on my phone.</p>\n<p>Words cannot express how happy that would make me.</p>\n<p>Before I continue with any of this I need an icon! If you see me tweeting a poorly traced Macaque face, this is why. If you too are interested in Ember, aside from the oficial docs, Robin Ward (Evil Trout) has a great <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eviltrout.com/2013/02/27/adding-to-discourse-part-1.html\">Ember series</a> on his blog.</p>\n<p><strong>Update: Part 2 —</strong> <a href=\"/2013/04/14/test-driven-development/\">Test Driven Development</a>\n<strong>Update: Part 3 —</strong> <a href=\"/2013/04/18/prototyping/\">Prototyping</a>\n<strong>Update: Part 4 —</strong> <a href=\"/2013/04/25/ember-data-and-mongodb/\">Ember Data and MongoDB</a></p>\n",
