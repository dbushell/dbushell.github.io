It includes basic HTML &amp; CSS and many <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gruntjs.com/\">Grunt</a> tasks to automate compilation, minification, optimisation, and rasterisation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-new\">What’s new</h2>\n<p>My custom <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/dbushell/dbushell-Origin/blob/master/tasks/rasterize.js\">SVG rasterisation task</a> was poorly written. It brought my laptop to a standstill while churning through as many phantom.js processes as there were SVG files. I’ve now improved that, mostly with a sexy progress bar:</p>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-lazy=\"false\" data-src=\"/images/2013/06/rasterize.png\" alt=\"rasterize task\"></p>\n<p><del>There’s probably a faster way using a single phantom.js instance but by the time I figure that out I won’t need PNG fallbacks for legacy browsers…</del> <strong>Update:</strong> I’ve now published <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-svg2png\">grunt-svg2png</a> to NPM and improved the speed performance dramatically! Instead of 30 seconds it’s done in less than 5.</p>\n<p>Because I’m generating some raster graphics on the fly I’ve had to manually optimise them using the ImageOptim desktop app. Now thanks to Jamie Mason’s awesome <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/JamieMason/grunt-imageoptim\">Grunt-ImageOptim</a> and <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/JamieMason/ImageOptim-CLI\">ImageOptim-CLI</a> that’s no longer the case! My automated build process now goes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create build folder</li>\n<li>Compile HTML templates</li>\n<li>Compile CSS (Sass with Compass)</li>\n<li>Copy assets (images, fonts, JavaScript)</li>\n<li>Minify JavaScript</li>\n<li>Optimise and rasterise SVG</li>\n<li>Optimise raster images</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The whole process takes less than a minute and I have a production ready <a href=\"/2013/04/05/the-flat-build-2/\">flat build</a>. I could do more with JavaScript (concatenation and testing) but my usual work hasn’t mandated much attention here. I should probably normal(-ise/-ize) spelling at some point.</p>\n",
