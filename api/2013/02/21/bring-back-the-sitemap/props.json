It’s an area of responsive design I enjoy <a href=\"https://dbushell.com/2013/02/07/on-responsive-navigation-and-rendering/\">experimenting with</a>.</p>\n<p>You’re probably familiar with <a href=\"http://bradfrost.github.com/this-is-responsive/patterns.html#navigation\">responsive patterns</a> that transform a traditional menu into something mobile-friendly. Combinations thereof cover most scenarios. If nothing suffices it might be more apt to focus on information architecture before attacking code again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h2>\n<p>For small viewports I’m a big fan of reveal patterns that initially hide the global menu. Doing so makes you remember that this menu isn’t the single point of navigation. It also begs the question: just how vital is a global menu?</p>\n<p>While researching the topic I stumbled upon <a href=\"http://yaronschoen.com/\">Yaron Schoen</a> and was pleased by his simple yet effective technique. Yaron’s site has no global menu. Instead he links to a single <a href=\"http://yaronschoen.com/table-of-contents/\">Table of Contents</a> page. Yaron inspired me to <a href=\"/table-of-contents/\">create my own</a>:</p>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><a href=\"/table-of-contents/\"><img src=\"/images/2013/02/table-of-contents.png\" alt=\"Table of Contents page design\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I’m not abandoning my global menu just yet but I do like this alternate overview. It’s a curated sitemap. It doesn’t list <em>every</em> page, just the ones I’m keen to show off.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-choice-of-direction\">A choice of direction</h2>\n<p>Right now this page is only accessible via a tiny link in the footer. The question I pose your way is this: <strong>do I add a link to my masthead?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"b-post__image\"><img src=\"/images/2013/02/dbushell-masthead.png\" alt=\"Masthead for dbushell.com\"></p>\n\n<p>And if so, what icon do I use? <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dbushell\">Answers in a tweet</a> please.</p>\n<p class=\"p--small\">I may bring back comments at some point this year!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"update-22nd-feb-2013-\">Update (22nd Feb 2013)</h2>\n<p>This post has received mixed reactions!</p>\n<p>I realise the terminology I’ve used isn’t helping to explain my thoughts. My personal demo isn’t much of an example either.</p>\n<p>“Sitemap” and “Table of Contents” have strong legacy connotations and my article title would suggest I’m referring back to such meanings. In a sense, I am, but exploring new ideas doesn’t always mean blinding ourselves to old ones.</p>\n<p>The web introduces a fluidity to design. It’s interactive. Potentially stateless. So suggestions that we should be inspired from the limitations of print-based media are rightly met with skepticism. Fair enough, but getting philosophical doesn’t do us much good when it comes to delivering a website.</p>\n<p>Presenting a large amount of content is an exercise in constraint. Give users enough options to narrow down their choice and no more. Design for discoverability. Sign-post for persuasion. Provide alternate search functionality. For the most part, we use multiple tiers of menus scoped to specific areas.</p>\n<p>A Sitemap in the traditional sense is just a dump of links. Not for human consumption. But a well presented table of contents offers a high-level overview of a website. This mental model is difficult to attain when browsing with a small viewport.</p>\n<p>I’m not suggesting it should ever replace normal navigation — that would defeat the point — only compliment it. It should still be restricted to top-level areas but more verbose than a menu can be. It’s not in your face. It’s optional.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t have to be an independent page either. I’m very much liking the “jump to big footer” technique many responsive sites are starting to employ.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://m.guardian.co.uk/\">The Guardian’s mobile site</a> integrates a similar concept. Select “All sections” from the global menu are you’re taken to a very functional table of contents. This doesn’t mean that specific categories can’t have their own sub-menu. It’s just an alternate route.</p>\n",
