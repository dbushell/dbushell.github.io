Below is a compilation of my favourite shows and a few suggestions.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://boagworld.com/show/\">Boagworld</a> was the first web industry podcast I ever listened to. I’m a huge fan of Paul’s video and audio blogging, something I wish others would emulate. Why do I only type? Might change that habit this year…</p>\n<p>Having recently “gone freelance” * I’m finding <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://unfinished.bz/\">Unfinished Business</a> with <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/anna_debenham\">Anna Debenham</a> and <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/malarkey\">Andy Clarke</a> to be absolutely invaluable. It really couldn’t have arrived at a more useful time. It’s five episodes in and already ticked off most of the uncertainties I had starting a new web design business.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://shoptalkshow.com/\">ShopTalk Show</a> is always a good laugh with superb guests, as is <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://happymondaypodcast.com/\">Happy Monday</a>.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://upfrontpodcast.com/\">Upfront Podcast</a> and <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://backtofrontshow.com/\">Back to Front Show</a> are two dev-orientated podcasts I’m keeping an ear on. Both have been entertaining so far.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://theeastwing.net/\">The East Wing</a> with <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ttimsmith\">Tim Smith</a> slipped under my radar but it’s bookmarked now.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://5by5.tv/\">5by5</a> and <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twit.tv/\">Twit</a> both have a whole host of shows I regularly dive into.</p>\n<p>Other Podcasts I need to catch up on are <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://theindustry.cc/category/podcast/\">The Industry</a>, <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://unmatchedstyle.com/bizcraft\">BizCraft</a>, <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nonbreakingspace.tv/\">The Non-Breaking Space Show</a> and <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fsm.bdconf.com/podcast\">Breaking Development</a>. I’m also looking forward to what <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/missrachilli\">Rachel Shillcock</a> has in store for <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beyondink.co.uk/\">Beyond Ink</a>.</p>\n<p>Anything I’m missing your favourite? <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twitter.com/dbushell\">I’m all ears</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p--small u-dim\"><em>* I quit an awesome job to offer my skills independently — <a href=\"/contact/\">booking projects now!</a></em></p>\n",
