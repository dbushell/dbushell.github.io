I don’t have the disposable income anymore for premium accounts! I’m keeping my <a href=\"https://github.com/dbushell\">open-source projects</a> on GitHub (while it remains fashionable). </p>\n<h2 id=\"multiple-ssh-keys\">Multiple SSH keys</h2>\n<p>Problem is, Bitbucket doesn’t allow you to use the same SSH key with more than one Bitbucket account. I still have my old work account to tidy up loose ends.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys\">GitHub explains</a> you can generate an SSH key like so:</p>\n<pre><code>cd ~/.ssh\nssh-keygen -t rsa -C &quot;your_email@youremail.com&quot;\n</code></pre><p>You are then prompted for an optional password. After the key is generate you copy &amp; paste it into your GitHub or Bitbucket account settings. On Mac OS X (10.8), which I’m using, copying to the clipboard is simple:</p>\n<pre><code>pbcopy &lt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n</code></pre><p>With multiple Bitbucket accounts (and I assume GitHub too) you need multiple SSH keys. To generate a second key with a different name:</p>\n<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/accountB -C &quot;your_email@youremail.com&quot;\n</code></pre><p>To use multiple keys create a file at <code>~/.ssh/config</code> with contents similar to:</p>\n<pre><code>Host bitbucket.org\n  User git\n  Hostname bitbucket.org\n  PreferredAuthentications publickey\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nHost bitbucket-accountB\n  User git\n  Hostname bitbucket.org\n  PreferredAuthentications publickey\n  IdentitiesOnly yes\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/accountB\n</code></pre><p>With this set up I can clone with my default key as Bitbucket suggests:</p>\n<pre><code>git clone git@bitbucket.org:username/project.git\n</code></pre><p>If I want to clone a repository from my second account I can alter the command to use the second SSH key I generated:</p>\n<pre><code>git clone git@bitbucket-accountB:username/project.git\n</code></pre><p>In fact, if I wanted to I could have a different SSH key for every account I have; GitHub, Bitbucket, or any other service that requires one.</p>\n<p>And that, my friends, is the sum of my knowledge in this area!</p>\n",
