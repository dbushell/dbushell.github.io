      "body": "What is meant by “browser support” when creating a website? Ensuring it is accessible by a browser is what I like to think of. Others may dream of pixel-perfection. Whatever “support” entails, browsers that don’t make the cut are universally ignored with much delight and little chance of being usable.\nIt’s common practice to maintain a […]",

In HTML it takes this form:\n&lt;a class=\"delete\" href=\"#\">Delete Item&lt;/a>\nThe anchor is styled up with sexy CSS3 and functionality is implemented with an asynchronous JavaScript API call. Because we all care about accessibility (and standards) we provide a “no-JS” fallback:\n&lt;a class=\"delete\" href=\"/item/delete/1/\">Delete Item&lt;/a>\nLovely! It’s great […]",
