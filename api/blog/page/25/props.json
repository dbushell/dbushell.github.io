      "body": "Those of us who care a little about progressive enhancement and accessibility will be well aware of the “JavaScript refresh”. This is when the page initially renders — visible to the user — before deferred JavaScript kicks in. Think jQuery’s $(document).ready() or similar.\nThis problem occurs from very good practices. We have to make sure pages are accessible pre-JavaScript. […]",
