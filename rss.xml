  <title><![CDATA[WordPress Gutenberg: React &amp; Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>The new WordPress Gutenberg editor has been in release for over a year now. Post content is composed of “blocks”. Everything is a block. From the humble paragraph to the more advanced gallery and video embed — all blocks.
There are two common methods to create Gutenberg blocks.
The first is to follow the offical handbook. Blocks […]</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Debugging a Todo App]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>So lately I’ve been boasting about how easy it is to build Progressive Web Apps. I’ve been dogfooding my glorified todo app Mute Swan for weeks thinking it was perfect (bug-free) and quite possibly a game changer, if I dare say.
As it turns out these things are not so easy to test. This week I […]</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Bundle a PWA as an Android App]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a website with a few extra pieces.
PWAs can be installed or bookmarked from the browser using “Add to Home Screen”. On Android 9 doing this via Firefox (v68, left) and Chrome (v80, right) gives two different results on my Samsung S8:

  


The Firefox icon isn’t desirable. Although the […]</p>]]></description>

Mozilla Observatory and Security Headers both scan HTTP headers and report back on adherence to, or lack thereof, best practices.
In my case dbushell.com gets a big fat “F”. I’m hosting on GitHub Pages so there is not much I can do except use […]</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Docker, WordPress, and Portless Localhost Domains]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Docker life chooses you. I bet a lot of developers have had a similar introduction. You’re brought onto a project and it’s like; “Hey we’re using Docker, just run ‘docker-compose up’.“ they say, “Sure, I know Docker,“ you shrug. Then you spend the better part of the week debugging.
I’ve worked on maybe two dozen […]</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Building a PWA with Netlify Functions]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago I took Netlify for a spin. I found the platform to be much easier to use than I’d anticipated. I was keen to test more features.
Netlify Functions provide back-end functionality through API endpoints. They’re powered by AWS Lambda. I’m using AWS for my contact form. It took me forever to […]</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[A Morning with Vue.js]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>I’m a React person but I’m not devoted to it. Honest! Earlier this week I found a morning to flirt with Vue.js.

My intention was to pen an article comparing the two frameworks. Upon reflection it feels somewhat pointless. Like React, Vue is primarily “focused on the view layer”. And like React, Vue does a pretty […]</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Netlify: First Impressions]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>Netlify is hot right now. It’s been hot for a while. It’s on my list of tech I pretend to know when people ask. I assume it handles static site hosting and deployment.

JAMstack is a popular/confusing term covering static sites and the new tech surrounding them. I’ve long adhered to such a philosophy for personal […]</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi there!
Do you need an experienced front-end dev person who can also consult, design, and figure out back-end integration with minimal Slack gifs? Well good news! I have a surplus of time in September and I can build (almost) anything.
You can contact me to discuss projects, requirements, costs, the weather.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This website – dbushell.com – or dbushell.app if you like redirects – is now a progressive web app!
What does that mean? Don’t let the fancy initialism deceive you. PWAs are websites first and foremost. But they can be installed like an app. What is meant by “app” depends on where it’s installed. As of writing […]</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[React &amp; Redux - Internationalisation]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>Internationalisation, i18n, localisation – whatever you prefer – can be tricky if your code does not support the ability to translate user interface text.
When writing React it’s easy to hard-code UI text right into the JavaScript. This is not good if your website or app needs to support multiple languages. Even if you only support […]</p>]]></description>

I’ve always used React PropTypes because it seemed like the ‘right way’ to do things. Runtime validation has obvious value but in my experience there are three big negatives to it:

  <description><![CDATA[<p>They’re a thing. Google describes them as a “technical foundation”.
What I’ve learnt is that a service worker is a JavaScript file. It runs in it’s own little world behind a website. That means it can’t access the DOM. What it can do is proxy network requests and access a storage cache.
I’m sure they can do […]</p>]]></description>
