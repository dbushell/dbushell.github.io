  <title><![CDATA[React as a Static Site Generator]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>Two years ago I converted my website from WordPress to a static build process. It has served me well but the final process was rather messy. Hacks and plumbing to get Metalsmith plugins working my way didn’t helped.
Time for a new project!
Abstract: rebuild my website using React as the template engine for a bespoke static […]</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Working with Promises]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>JavaScript promises are a handy way to write asynchronous code. It’s common to have multiple promises resolve in parallel or series.
Let’s say you have several functions that return a promise:
function act1() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) &#x3D;&gt; {
    // do something that might reject...
    resolve();
  });
}

It’s easy […]</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[My thoughts on React]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been playing with React for some time now. React is:

“A JavaScript library for building user interfaces”.

Unlike other libraries something about React just clicked with me. Back in October a client project came along that presented a golden opportunity to develop a web app. I decided to use React, and I now consider myself comfortable […]</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Shopify is an ecommerce platform that offers themeable store fronts online. I worked alongside the wonderful folks at Studio Tangerine to develop a Shopify theme. I’ve documented interesting aspects of the process below.

  <title><![CDATA[Colour Accessibility]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>“Accessiblity” isn’t a scary word but many web folks shy away from it. Perhaps because the W3C guidelines are a little scary. The reality is website accessibility affects us all. Not just those of us who cross the threshold into a medically diagnosed condition.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Greetings! It’s been a while, hasn’t it? The last few months were busy for me. That’s a good thing I suppose, I certainly need to earn a living.
The only real downside of plentiful client work is the lack of time for my own projects. One of those, codename: “Origin”, is my personal front-end starter kit. […]</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[CSS only Responsive Tables]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>Four years ago I shared an idea to make tabular data responsive. Browser support was experimental and the workarounds were extremely hacky. I revisited the technique this week, cleaned it up, and I am pleased to say all modern browsers work perfectly.

Here’s what basic overflow looks like:

This iteration has taken longer than usual because the visual changes are much more dramatic. I’m really pleased with the results:


It’s been two years since I last updated the design. That is a record because it’s usually an annual tradition. Past updates include: 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011. Last year I improved […]</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Content should follow a logical top-to-bottom order within HTML. CSS is used to change the visual presentation of this content across different viewports.
On small viewports — mobile phones for example — a vertical layout that mimics the HTML order is generally a safe default. For wider viewports it is common to introduce more complex layout […]</p>]]></description>
