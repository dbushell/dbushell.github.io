  <title><![CDATA[A Morning with Vue.js]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>I’m a React person but I’m not devoted to it. Honest! Earlier this week I found a morning to flirt with Vue.js.

My intention was to pen an article comparing the two frameworks. Upon reflection it feels somewhat pointless. Like React, Vue is primarily “focused on the view layer”. And like React, Vue does a pretty […]</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Netlify: First Impressions]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>Netlify is hot right now. It’s been hot for a while. It’s on my list of tech I pretend to know when people ask. I assume it handles static site hosting and deployment.

JAMstack is a popular/confusing term covering static sites and the new tech surrounding them. I’ve long adhered to such a philosophy for personal […]</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey, I went a whole year without blogging!
I guess the streak is officially over. The lack of content here has weighed on me heavily considering how integral this blog has been to my career. Really, it was my true portfolio. It demonstrated much more than the glossy screenshots on other pages ever did. And now […]</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi there!
Do you need an experienced front-end dev person who can also consult, design, and figure out back-end integration with minimal Slack gifs? Well good news! I have a surplus of time in September and I can build (almost) anything.
You can contact me to discuss projects, requirements, costs, the weather.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This website – dbushell.com – or dbushell.app if you like redirects – is now a progressive web app!
What does that mean? Don’t let the fancy initialism deceive you. PWAs are websites first and foremost. But they can be installed like an app. What is meant by “app” depends on where it’s installed. As of writing […]</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[React &amp; Redux - Internationalisation]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>Internationalisation, i18n, localisation – whatever you prefer – can be tricky if your code does not support the ability to translate user interface text.
When writing React it’s easy to hard-code UI text right into the JavaScript. This is not good if your website or app needs to support multiple languages. Even if you only support […]</p>]]></description>

Stuff like this styled range input:

I’ve long been a paying user of CodePen. It’s nice for sharing snippets, quick mock-ups, or messing around with code. CodePen Projects is a newish addition. It provides a more complete development environment.
A mini-project came along for a client that gave me the perfect excuse to try CodePen Projects.

I’ve always used React PropTypes because it seemed like the ‘right way’ to do things. Runtime validation has obvious value but in my experience there are three big negatives to it:

  <title><![CDATA[The Magic of Service Workers]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>They’re a thing. Google describes them as a “technical foundation”.
What I’ve learnt is that a service worker is a JavaScript file. It runs in it’s own little world behind a website. That means it can’t access the DOM. What it can do is proxy network requests and access a storage cache.
I’m sure they can do […]</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Working with Promises]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>JavaScript promises are a handy way to write asynchronous code. It’s common to have multiple promises resolve in parallel or series.
Let’s say you have several functions that return a promise:
function act1() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) &#x3D;&gt; {
    // do something that might reject...
    resolve();
  });
}
