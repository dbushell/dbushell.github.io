  <title><![CDATA[Turn the Pi-hole Admin Dashboard into a Progressive Web App]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>Pi-hole describes itself as “A black hole for Internet advertisements”. I think the GitHub description is more apt:

The Pi-hole® is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content …

Fewer ads are nice, but tracker and malware blocking at the LAN DNS level is nicer. Pi-hole is the first install of my self-hosted adventure.

  <title><![CDATA[Hardware and Self Hosting]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>Today my main computer is a Mac Mini 2018. Quite likely the last Mac I’ll buy for day-to-day work. I’d like it to last a little longer than previous ones. Following Apple’s ARM chip announcement I have my doubts about future support.
Here’s my office setup:

  <title><![CDATA[PWA Encryption and Auto Sign-in]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>Mute Swan is a progressive web app I’ve been coding for my own amusement. It’s a playground for me to mess around with experimental web standards. Also to remind myself to buy milk.

  


I’ve recently implemented hidden Dropbox backup and sync functionality. With that in place I decided that my grocery list was of […]</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Bubblewrap Apps in Android Studio]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bubblewrap is a convenient tool to generate an Android app from a Progressive Web App. I used it to bundle my PWA recently.
It’s run from the command line:
bubblewrap init --manifest &quot;https://muteswan.app/manifest.webmanifest&quot;
Bubblewrap generates the build config and assets for the app. Continuing with bubblewrap build results in an .apk if you’ve installed the Android build tools.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Following my last article I’ve published a new GitHub repo:
WordPress Gutenberg Example Blocks
In there I’ve coded examples of Gutenberg block development wrapped up in a tidy WordPress plugin you can try out.
I start with the most basic block possible. I follow with iterations of more advanced functionality. I’ve kept the boilerplate and dependencies to a […]</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>The new WordPress Gutenberg editor has been in release for over a year. Post content is composed of “blocks”. Everything is a block. From the humble paragraph to the more advanced gallery and video embed — all blocks.
There are two common methods to create Gutenberg blocks.
The first is to follow the offical handbook. Blocks and […]</p>]]></description>

As it turns out these things are not so easy to test. This week I […]</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a website with a few extra pieces.
PWAs can be installed or bookmarked from the browser using “Add to Home Screen”. On Android 9 doing this via Firefox (v68, left) and Chrome (v80, right) gives two different results on my Samsung S8:

  


The Firefox icon isn’t desirable. Although the […]</p>]]></description>

Mozilla Observatory and Security Headers both scan HTTP headers and report back on adherence to, or lack thereof, best practices.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Docker life chooses you. I bet a lot of developers have had a similar introduction. You’re brought onto a project and it’s like; “Hey we’re using Docker, just run ‘docker-compose up’.“ they say, “Sure, I know Docker,“ you shrug. Then you spend the better part of the week debugging.
I’ve worked on maybe two dozen […]</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[A Morning with Vue.js]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>I’m a React person but I’m not devoted to it. Honest! Earlier this week I found a morning to flirt with Vue.js.

My intention was to pen an article comparing the two frameworks. Upon reflection it feels somewhat pointless. Like React, Vue is primarily “focused on the view layer”. And like React, Vue does a pretty […]</p>]]></description>

Do you need an experienced front-end dev person who can also consult, design, and figure out back-end integration with minimal Slack gifs? Well good news! I have a surplus of time in September and I can build (almost) anything.
You can contact me to discuss projects, requirements, costs, the weather.
