  <description><![CDATA[<p>I‚Äôve started a new Code Snippets collection on CodePen. It will be populated with the little and sometimes peculiar CSS techniques I‚Äôve used. Mostly CSS but with occasional JavaScript sprinkles. Progressively enhanced, of course.
Stuff like this styled range input:

I‚Äôve long been a paying user of CodePen. It‚Äôs nice for sharing snippets, quick mock-ups, or messing around with code. CodePen Projects is a newish addition. It provides a more complete development environment.

I‚Äôve always used React PropTypes because it seemed like the ‚Äòright way‚Äô to do things. Runtime validation has obvious value but in my experience there are three big negatives to it:

What I‚Äôve learnt is that a service worker is a JavaScript file. It runs in it‚Äôs own little world behind a website. That means it can‚Äôt access the DOM. What it can do is proxy network requests and access a storage cache.
